Promoting Sustainability


Sustainability Policy	Materiality (key sustainability issues)
 

Toyota is working on initiatives that contribute to the sustainable development of society and the world through all its business activities in cooperation with global society. Toyota aims to become a company that is admired and trusted by society by sharing and implementing its sustainability-related policies with all its employees, including those in consolidated subsidiaries.
Organization
As the automobile industry is entering a once-in-a-century transformational period in which the need to solve social issues is becoming increasingly urgent, companies are required to enhance their commitment to promoting sustainability. Toyota
 

Toyota has been committed to resolving various social issues through its business activities. As the issues become increasingly diversified and complicated and in view of the ever-changing social trends and external voices, Toyota has identified six key issues that it needs to focus particular efforts on as materiality issues, with the aim of both contributing to society and sustainably enhancing its own corporate value. In the process of identifying the six issues, first we referred to and examined various international norms and guidelines and listed up various issues. Then we gathered external viewpoints, including the opinions of third parties and the priority items of evaluation organizations. We also examined internal viewpoints and organized them from two perspectives to enhance our corporate value: our “founding spirit,” which represents our principles, strengths and other factors that we have cultivated and that will not change, and factors that we should change or reinforce in the process of our “transformation into a mobility company.” At the same time, we discussed and evaluated the issues to determine whether they are critical issues that will enable Toyota to make further contributions toward building a sustainable society in line with the SDGs.

Process of identification
 
set up the Sustainability Management Dept. in 2019 to enable the entire company to promote integrated sustainability initiatives by determining priorities. In 2020, Toyota appointed a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO and director) and a Deputy Chief Sustainability Officer (DCSO) as leaders of the promotion. The Sustainability Meeting, chaired by the CSO and attended by members including Outside Directors and Outside Audit &
Supervisory Board Members, discusses and reports on sustainability issues and directions for solutions. The results of the discussions
are reported to the Board of Directors, a supervisory organ of the

Promoting Sustainability





Toyota’s SDGs
Since its founding, Toyota has maintained the Toyoda Precepts, or five main principles of founder Sakichi Toyoda, and contributed to creating an affluent society through its business activities, with the aim
of becoming a reliable corporate citizen in the international community. In this spirit, we have tackled various challenges in society. By applying the Toyota Production System and other technologies we have fostered in our monozukuri (manufacturing), we have developed the world’s first commercial hybrid vehicle aimed at resolving environmental issues. We have also contributed to society by making “ever- better cars” that make our customers happy, which has led to the establishment of a stable business base. This virtuous circle has enabled us to achieve sustainable growth for our business activities.

Today, propelled by a series of technical innovations called CASE, the automobile industry is entering a once-in-a-century transformational period. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Toyota is transforming itself from an automobile manufacturing company into a mobility company. By making the best of our strengths cultivated through manufacturing while adapting ourselves to technological innovations centered on CASE, we will further expand the potential of automobiles and offer services that make freedom of mobility available to everyone. The development of automated driving and other advanced technologies, for example, is a solution to Toyota’s ultimate challenge: zero deaths and injuries from traffic accidents.
Through these initiatives, Toyota hopes to provide society with greatly improved value and contribute to the achievement of SDGs through its businesses. Toyota will also continue to proactively promote social
contribution activities with a view to becoming a reliable corporate citizen.	 
Meanwhile, to realize a sustainable society, which the SDGs are aimed at, efforts in tackling ESG issues, such as human rights and diversity, are necessary. We will enhance our initiatives to address these social issues and promote diversity among our employees, who are our assets, to help them to survive the period of transformation, thereby creating changes in society while leveraging such changes for the further growth of Toyota itself.
Toyota believes that it can also contribute to society through promoting motorsports, the purpose of which is to enjoy movement itself, and corporate sport activities, which Toyota has consistently
supported since its founding. Seeing those who challenge their limits gives you a heart-pumping feeling excitement (waku-doki). This is one of the values that we should maintain for creating a more affluent society in the future.
 

Promoting Sustainability





 
Stakeholder Engagement

Toyota will engage in stakeholder-oriented management to contribute to sustainable development and strive to maintain and develop sound relationships with stakeholders through open and fair communication. Specifically, Toyota’s relevant divisions and offices all over the world act as the main
 
contacts to hold dialogues with major stakeholders. They communicate Toyota’s policy and also help deepen mutual understanding. Additionally, Toyota maintains communication with external experts to examine, for example, the direction of its sustainability-related initiatives.
Toyota will continue to further strengthen dialogue with stakeholders to earnestly address society’s expectations and to utilize them in our future initiatives.

Promoting Sustainability





Public policy

Toyota has always maintained transparent and fair relationships with political parties and the administration (government agencies) and endeavored to take appropriate action in accordance with laws and regulations globally. While working to maintain sound relationships, we will share expertise and the values of Toyota, exchange opinions, and hold dialogues with the governments of various countries toward the goal of solving various social issues. We respect all our stakeholders, not only political and administrative organs, including our customers, local communities and employees, and cooperate with them, thereby achieving producing happiness for all.
Toyota places a high priority on activities through industry organizations. Many Toyota management executives and employees have participated in various committees of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) and the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren). For example, seeing the environment as one of the priority field, Toyota proactively participated in the formulation of the JAMA's long-term vision for Global Warming Prevention, which formulate the zero CO2 emissions challenge, and Keidanren’s Challenge Zero declaration, which aims at a decarbonized society through innovation.
Toyota respects its founding spirit and SDGs and will make efforts to realize a future mobility society where freedom of mobility is available to all and to establish closer economic relationships with various foreign countries. To this end, we will continuously promote activities by enhancing cooperation within the Toyota Group, and with automobile manufacturers associations and economic organizations both inside and outside Japan.

Fundamental Approach

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) survey*, 1.35 million people worldwide died in traffic accidents. While the number of deaths due to traffic accidents has been decreasing slightly in Japan, the United States and Europe, it has been constantly increasing in emerging nations and regions where traffic safety education and transportation infrastructure have not kept up with increases in the number of cars on the road. Unless countermeasures are implemented, traffic fatalities are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of accidental death by 2030.
If Toyota is to achieve its ultimate goal of Zero Casualties from Traffic Accidents, the development of safe vehicles is of course important, but it is also essential to educate people, including drivers and pedestrians,
and to ensure a safe traffic infrastructure including traffic signals and roads.

Pursuing Real-world Safety
 
Investigation and analysis of accidents

Toward achieving a safe mobility society, Toyota believes it is important to promote an integrated three-part initiative, involving people, vehicles and the traffic environment, as well as to pursue real-world safety by learning from actual accidents and incorporating that knowledge into vehicle development. Toyota has also defined its Integrated Safety Management Concept as the basic philosophy behind technologies toward achieving the elimination of traffic casualties and is moving forward with developing these technologies.

Integrated Safety Management Concept

 
Toyota provides optimum driver support for each stage of driving, from parking to normal operation, the accident itself, the pre-and post-crash timeframe and post-accident rescue. Toyota’s approach is to enhance safety levels through strengthening inter-system coordination rather than seeing each system separately. These are the approaches behind our Integrated Safety Management Concept.

Status of Traffic Accidents and Toyota’s Safety Technology

 
There were 3,215 traffic fatalities in Japan in 2019, a drop of 317 people over the previous year. This was the lowest number since the National Police Agency began keeping records in 1948. Classified by road users, pedestrians accounted for the largest number of deaths, with the percentage of fatalities among the elderly (65 years or older) increasing yearly.
Another emerging issue is accidents caused by drivers pressing the accelerator by mistake instead of the brake in parking lots, or driving the wrong way down expressways, which are both more common among the elderly. This is becoming a major social issue.
For this reason, more and more attention is being given to active safety technologies that help prevent accidents in addition to the existing passive safety features.
At Toyota, we are working on installing the Toyota Safety Sense system that packages multiple active safety systems, including collision damage mitigation braking, in almost all our passenger vehicle models (Japan, United States, and Europe). In Japan, we are also working on developing the Intelligent Clearance Sonar (ICS) (Parking Support Brakes [Stationary Objects]), which helps prevent accidents caused by pressing the wrong pedal. We have also developed a new sudden acceleration suppression system to help prevent accidents caused by pressing the wrong pedal in a road condition with no obstacles, which will be installed in subsequent Toyota vehicles.
In Japan, Toyota has also launched the HELPNET® service, an emergency reporting system to arrange an emergency vehicle in the event of an accident or sudden illness.

Active Safety

 
Toyota Safety Sense (Active Safety Package)
The Toyota Safety Sense system incorporates three major functions considered effective in reducing serious traffic accidents causing death or injury. It packages multiple active safety functions based around Pre-Collision Safety (PCS), which works to either help avoid collisions with cars ahead or pedestrians, Lane Departure Alert (LDA), which contributes to preventing accidents caused by leaving the lane, and Automatic High Beam (AHB), which helps ensure clear sight in front at night. In 2018, we enhanced functions to support driving, such as detecting nighttime pedestrians and daytime crossing cyclists, and Lane Tracing Assist (LTA).
For the Yaris launched in February 2020 (Japan), functions to detect pedestrians when turning right or left at intersections and oncoming cars when turning right were added to PCS. Since its market launch in 2015, Toyota Safety Sense has been installed in more than 14 million vehicles globally (as of February 2020). Toyota Safety Sense is now available on nearly all passenger cars (as standard or option) in the Japanese, United States and European markets. It has also been introduced in a total of 108 countries and regions, including China, other select Asian countries, the Middle East and Australia.
Pedal Misapplication Prevention System
In Japan, about 30 percent of all traffic accidents are said to occur in parking lots.*1 Furthermore, drivers who are 75 years older tend to be involved in a large percentage of accidents caused by pedal misapplication in parking lots and other areas.*2 To help remedy this situation, Toyota has installed Intelligent Clearance Sonars (ICS) since 2012. For vehicles that are already owned by customers, Toyota introduced the pedal misapplication acceleration control system that can be retrofitted in 2018. It is currently available for 12 models (Japan).
These systems activate when the sensor detects an obstacle, such as a car or a wall. However, some of

the accidents caused by pedal misapplication occurred when there were no obstacles on the road. To reduce such accidents, Toyota developed the sudden acceleration suppression function to help prevent accidents caused by pressing the wrong pedal in a road condition with no obstacles, and began installing it from the Prius and the Prius PHV launched in July 2020. This function has also been incorporated in the retrofit pedal misapplication acceleration control system since July 2020 (Japan).
Based on the principle that safety lies in the domain of cooperation, Toyota has disclosed the concept of the sudden acceleration suppression function and its specific operating
conditions to other car manufacturers from the development stage,

Accident Reduction Effects
In real traffic environments, installation of the ICS in cars has reduced the number of accidents caused by pedal misapplication by about 70 percent. It has also been confirmed that the ICS in combination with Toyota Safety Sense has reduced rear-end collisions by about 90 percent (Japan, Toyota comparison).

THUMS, a virtual body model
THUMS are used by over 100 car manufacturers and parts manufacturers, universities and research institutions both inside and outside Japan mainly for studies on vehicle safety. By preparing and using models of a variety of bodies in terms of gender, age and size, researchers are able to conduct safety research on themes focusing on diversity, such as a comparison of injuries in collisions and the method to mitigate injuries to various types of people.
 

 
 
Passive safety combines a body structure that absorbs collision energy with devices that efficiently protect the vehicle occupants to minimize collision damage. In 1995, Toyota set up unique, stringent internal goals related to passive safety performance called “Global Outstanding Assessment (GOA)” in the pursuit of world-leading safety levels and developed a collision-safety body and passenger protection devices. Since then, to maintain leadership in this field, Toyota has continued to advance GOA, improving the real safety performance of its vehicles in a wide variety of accidents.

To analyze the human body injury mechanism, Toyota developed its Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS), a virtual body model, jointly with Toyota Central R&D Labs., Inc. Use of THUMS has enabled detailed analysis of injuries to various parts of the human body in a traffic accident, and it is being utilized effectively in research and development of various safety technologies, including safety equipment such as seat belts and airbags and vehicle structures that mitigate injuries in accidents involving pedestrians.
Toyota plans to make THUMS software freely available in January 2021, in the hope of making a broad

Every minute counts in an emergency response to an accident or sudden illness. In 2000, Toyota rolled out its HELPNET® service, an emergency reporting system utilizing the G-Book information network (the current T-Connect) and G-Link. In the event of an accident or sudden illness, HELPNET® contacts a dedicated operator who will arrange for the rapid dispatch of an emergency vehicle with police or fire department responders. The service automatically contacts an operator when the airbag deploys and supports D-Call Net® which makes quick deployment decisions for air ambulances, etc. now available nationwide. This service is provided by sending vehicle data to the HELPNET center from an on-board data communication module (DCM). DCM has been installed as a standard feature in the Crown and Corolla Sports, launched in June 2018, and in all subsequent new passenger vehicles in Japan.

Automated Driving

To help achieve zero casualties from traffic accidents, Toyota has been conducting research and development on automated driving technologies since the 1990s. Toyota’s unique approach to automated driving, called the “Mobility Teammate Concept,” seeks out a relationship between people and vehicles so that they can communicate and mutually improve one another as companions would. Based on this philosophy, Toyota is aiming to help build a world in which every person, including the elderly and the physically challenged, can enjoy mobility safely, easily and freely.
The Lexus Teammate and Toyota Teammate are advanced drive support technologies developed based on the Mobility Teammate Concept. With the functions of Advanced Drive for drive support on motor highways and Advanced Park for parking support in parking lots, these technologies enable the driver and the car to collaborate in raising the safety level and drive with the sense of a high level of security while providing tireless, comfortable travel through the destination.
 
Initiatives Targeting People
Believing that educating people is also important in preventing traffic accidents, Toyota started donating traffic safety teaching materials for small children in the form of traffic safety picture books given to children starting kindergarten and nursery schools nationwide in the 1960s, in cooperation with Toyota dealers nationwide. Since then, Toyota has been holding the Toyota Safety School designed for small children every year. In 2005, we established the Toyota Safety Education Center Mobilitas at the Fuji Speedway. We also hold Toyota Driver Communication, a safe driving technique seminar aimed at drivers.
Additionally, with the spread of the Safety Support Car (Sapo Car) program recommended by the government, we are working with Toyota dealers to continue to spread our safety technologies further and keep our customers informed. This is why we are rolling out Support Toyota (the overall name for our safety and assurance activities) to help achieve car lifestyles that offer safety and assurance.
 

Support for Initiatives at the Collaborative Safety Research Center (CSRC) in the U.S.
In January 2011, with the goal of establishing safer and more reliable transportation, Toyota established the CSRC inside the Toyota Technical Center (TTC) located in the state of Michigan. The first-phase project was completed at the CSRC in March 2017. Over a five-year period, the CSRC started and completed 44 research projects jointly with 23 universities and research organizations, publishing more than 200 technical papers.
The CSRC has been making its research results public through presentations at various vehicle safety- related conferences so that these results can be utilized by people engaged in the development of vehicle and traffic safety technologies.
In 2017, Toyota started a new second-phase project called “CSRC Next.” This reflects Toyota’s position that it is important to understand how humans will cope with advancing vehicle technologies. Toyota will invest 35 million dollars over five years in research focusing on issues related to and the possibilities of autonomous driving and connected vehicle technologies, and publish the research results publicly, thereby contributing to safer vehicles industry-wide.

Quality and Customer First


 
Fundamental Approach

The origins of Toyota’s “Customer First” and “Quality First” principles lie in the Five Main Principles of Toyoda, which embody the thinking of Sakichi Toyoda, and the spirit of audit and improvement of Kiichiro Toyoda. Since its foundation, Toyota has established a corporate culture that focuses particular attention on quality that will produce customer smiles and on kaizen (continuous improvement) achieved through genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience). Each employee in every area maintains a constant and strong awareness of issues and a sense of ownership and makes ongoing efforts to implement kaizen and to collaborate closely with personnel in other fields to enhance customer safety, peace of mind, and satisfaction.

Quality
Toyota sees quality as a combination of product quality, sales and service quality, and the quality of work performed by each employee that serves, as the foundation supporting the other aspects of quality.
We believe that products and services that gain the confidence of customers can be only created when all employees who engage in every process, from development, purchasing, production, and sales to after-sales service activities, build quality into their work and implement the quality assurance cycle by linking the various processes.


Toyota’s Concept of Quality

 

 
 
Organizational Structure

 
The fundamentals of the initiatives are function management and policy management. Function management refers to setting company-wide policies based on functional parameters such as quality and safety, with each group and company taking action in collaboration with other divisions. Policy management refers to the formulation and implementation of plans for achieving targets in each group and company, based on the company-wide policy.
In terms of policy management for quality functions, policies and important issues related to quality are discussed and decided at meetings of the Quality Function Board, the highest-order conferences of Toyota related to quality, attended by presidents of companies and officers of relevant groups, thereby promoting company-wide quality improvement. Each year, Toyota formulates a plan for addressing company-wide quality issues and ensuring quality corresponding to new businesses and technologies, and deploys it as our quality function policy throughout the company. In order to strengthen regionally led quality improvement activities capable of making decisions and taking actions as close as possible to local customers, Toyota has appointed a Global Chief Quality Officer (Global CQO) in Japan and Chief Quality Officers (CQOs) in other regions around the world. For the meeting of the Quality Function Board held in January, the CQOs are gathered from all regions to discuss quality function policies.
Additionally, each region has organized a variety of quality-related conferences. For the highest-order conference chaired by the regional CQO, Toyota Motor Corporation sends our Global CQO or a secretariat member in order to facilitate and support better communication and collaboration. Toyota also shares our quality function policy with our affiliated group companies and suppliers, promoting collaborative actions for ensuring quality. Moreover, initiatives implemented under the quality function policy are reported to the management, including directors, each month, and are properly addressed.

Global Policy Implementation Structure and the Quality Conference
 
from the experiences Toyota underwent at that time.
For example, in 2014 Toyota established its Customer Quality Learning Center as education facility for conveying the experiences and lessons Toyota learned from the series of recall issues to future generations of employees. Using exhibits that appeal to the five senses, such as actual examples of faulty parts and vehicle simulators, the center acts as an important education facility for conveying the situation back then to current Toyota employees.
In addition to posting the status of the series of recall issues, current quality issues are added every year to renew the program. We are making these efforts to create key education facilities for maintaining focus on all that Toyota learned. We have also set up customer quality learning centers unique to individual plants and overseas sites, and are working to ensure employees in each region and each plant thoroughly understand the importance of quality. Additionally, employees who experienced the series of recall issues take on the role of storyteller to convey the experiences and lessons learned within their own work sites.

Establishing Quality Assurance Structure toward Transformation into a “Mobility” Company
As the automotive industry faces an era of profound transformation, the likes of which come only once every 100 years, Toyota is taking many steps to transform itself into a “mobility” company. In the mobility society that will arrive in the future, in addition to automobiles’ basic safety and comfort (quality of things), in such areas as running, turning, and stopping, it is necessary to ensure the quality and security of the

communication automobiles use to connect to people, things, and cities. The quality of the telecommunication	 	
 
platform and servers, which control the operations of services, must also be ensured in order to guarantee the quality of customers’ experiences (quality of experiences) obtained through mobility services. With this in mind, Toyota is also making company-wide efforts to strengthen the quality assurance process, including in its services, in order to provide high-quality products and services that bring a smile to customers’ faces in its mobility businesses.
Fostering Quality-oriented Awareness and Culture
“Customer First,” “Quality First,” and “Build in Quality in Processes.” Based on the principles we have maintained since our foundation, to foster a corporate culture in which each member is committed to building high quality, Toyota has been working to instill Toyota’s common values, represented by the Five Main Principles of Toyoda, and Our Attitudes* in which Customer First is listed as the first attitude. Toyota has also set up several company-wide quality promotion events throughout the year, such as Quality Month, Customer’s Month, and Toyota Restart Day, thereby encouraging each member’s further quality- based thinking and actions, and fostering a quality-oriented culture.
February 24, the day that President Akio Toyoda attended U.S. Congressional hearings, held to investigate the series of recall issues that occurred in 2010, was designated “Toyota Restart Day.” We are creating mechanisms and taking measures to raise awareness in order to maintain focus on the lessons learned
 
Toyota has established a global system to identify quality risks and promptly respond to them. In each region around the world, CQO leads the efforts to improve and enhance the quality assurance system. Toyota also appoints a Regional Product Safety Executive (RPSE) for each region, with the aim of establishing a quality risk management structure capable of making appropriate decisions that represent the voices of local customers. This structure is expected to facilitate global sharing of quality risks, proper actions from the standpoint of local customers, and prompt response to emergencies on a global scale.

Auditing
Toyota conducts internal audits at least once a year with the aim of further enhancing proper quality assurance activities in accordance with the laws and regulations of each country and internal rules. Internal auditors with ample knowledge of ISO 9001, Toyota’s quality assurance rules and systems, and auditing methods, form an auditing team, and conduct audits focusing on the audit points that have been determined based on the environmental changes both inside and outside the company, quality indicators and other factors. Audit results are shared with the relevant parties, so that necessary measures for improvement can be promptly implemented. Toyota sincerely listens to the opinions of third parties, including the certification organizations of each country, and reflects them in the enhancement of our quality assurance activities.

Collaboration with Suppliers
New suppliers:
Before starting a transaction with a new supplier, Toyota mainly checks the supplier’s technical capabilities, such as design development and quality management, in order to solidify the foundation for ensuring quality.
Existing suppliers:
In order to build the product quality that Toyota aims at in close cooperation with suppliers, Toyota shares with suppliers manuals compiling the necessary actions to be taken by the suppliers and Toyota, respectively, in each stage from production preparation to mass production, thereby raising common quality awareness. Toyota also shares the checklist for self-inspection of the quality management structure and production processes with suppliers, and regularly examines the inspection results and improvement plans, with the aim of achieving further quality improvement.

Coping with Quality Problems

 
We have a system whereby each employee takes action to enhance quality in accordance with the Customer First Principle, and prepares for and responds in a timely manner to quality-related issues. Based on the belief that nothing is more important than helping customers use their vehicles safely, and in order to minimize trouble to customers by taking prompt action, we make recall decisions by determining quality failures not simply based on legal compliance, but also from the customer’s perspective, putting safety and assurance first. Final decisions are made with the participation of regional representatives, who are closest to the customers, to ensure that feedback from regional customers is accurately reflected.
 
After a decision to recall is made, Toyota contacts individual customers through dealers, and additionally posts information on our website to ensure prompt repair service.

Customer First Measures
Toyota’s principle of Customer First exists to provide customers with products and services that satisfy them. Toyota hopes to offer cars with superior features in terms of environmental, safety and quality performance while also offering the intrinsic appeal of cars, such as high driving performance, as well as services for comfortable “movement” at affordable prices.
We respectfully and willingly accept information provided by our dealers and customer feedback received at customer assistance centers, and utilizing them to make ever-better cars.


System for Implementing Customer Feedback

In responding to customer inquiries, opinions and requests, the most recent customer feedback is gathered from dealers. Also, we have established customer assistance centers and the actions we take lead to the creation of ever-better cars and services.
 
Toyota Customer Assistance Center and Lexus Information Desk
The Toyota Customer Assistance Center and the Lexus Information Desk are open for consultation 365 days a year, and have been established around a structure designed to ensure constant customer satisfaction.
Toyota offers speedy, appropriate and empathetic responses to customer inquiries and listens to opinions and requests based on the principle of Customer First. At the same time, Toyota addresses all issues while maintaining close cooperation with its dealers.
Additionally, a Salesperson Support Desk has been established to support dealers in implementing the Customer First principle.
Toyota also conducts surveys of customers who use our telephone service via an automated response system in an effort to continue to make improvements.

Toyota has declared every May as Customer’s Month to coincide with the designation of May as Consumer’s Month by the Japanese government, with initiatives aimed at spreading awareness of the Customer First principle throughout the company. The Customer Feedback Exhibitions present feedback from customers around the world, as well as initiatives taken from the customer’s perspective. The exhibitions serve as forums for each employee to reconfirm the importance of listening to customer feedback.
As part of employee education, “Experience and Learn from Customer Feedback” sessions are held to observe and experience the functioning of our call center, the Customer Assistance Center. A Customer Feedback Board summarizing customer feedback has been added to the company intranet, drawing employee attention to issues of concern to customers.
Additionally, we are actively encouraging some of our employees to obtain the Consumer Affairs Advisor qualification, which is certified by Japan’s Prime Minister and the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry. Facility and vehicle evaluations from the customer’s viewpoint are also held by a group of experts in the Toyota Consumer Affairs Advisor Group.

After-sales Service

 
To bring smiles to the faces of as many customers as possible, it is essential to simultaneously achieve both better cars and better after-sales service. Customer’s cars require regular check-ups, legally mandated inspections and repairs following breakdowns or accidents. After-sales service provides safety, peace of mind and comfort to customers at these times and provides continuous support for the Toyota and Lexus brands.
In recent years, the average length of time for which a car is used is increasing. As a result, the role of after-sales service is becoming increasingly important. Toyota is taking measures to provide ever-better
services in accordance with the concept of the 3S Spirit (Seikaku + Shinsetsu = Shinrai: Accuracy + Caring
= Trust) so that we can achieve high levels of satisfaction for our customers in using their Toyota vehicles.

Better service means the ability to safely, accurately, promptly and inexpensively perform maintenance and repairs in cases of breakdown. To do this, we are working to enhance the serviceability of vehicles and the availability of service parts so they can be repaired quickly, and to train service engineers.
Based on the idea that after-sales service begins at the stage of vehicle development, we believe that serviceability is also one aspect of a car’s performance, and we incorporate serviceability improvements based on market feedback and repair records into our vehicle development.
Toyota has also established a system to deliver parts exactly when they are needed to countries around the world so that repairs and other services can be completed speedily. Parts inventories and inspection work are being made more efficient by applying Toyota Production System concepts at dealer worksites.

Better Service and Supporting Factors


Safety	Accuracy	Promptness	Inexpensive
 
In terms of the tools needed to support our service operations, the number of diagnostic codes for identifying failure causes has been increased. When the on-board computer performs self-diagnosis and detects a fault, it sends the diagnostic code for the failed part to the dealer so that the part causing the problem in the vehicle can be quickly identified. We are also taking innovative steps to improve service operation efficiency by reducing the number of frequently performed operations or automating them.
Service, technology, sales and other divisions are collaborating on repair techniques to deploy easy-to- repair car manufacturing. They also provide necessary information quickly and make repair work speedy and easy.
There are currently approximately 180,000 Toyota personnel involved in after-sales service globally, and educational systems and facilities are being established in each region. The Tajimi Service Center in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, plays a central role in enhancing the knowledge and technical skills of service staff worldwide.


Helping Customers Use Their Vehicles Safely
User manuals and information on the latest models are available on the Toyota website to help customers enjoy driving their vehicles safely and comfortably.
We are also utilizing the product information provision tools for distributors and dealers as well as the company website to accurately communicate the risks resulting from operational errors.


Initiative with Toyota National Dealers’ Advisory Council
Since dealers offer services to customers directly, Toyota is working with dealers to provide ever-better cars and ever-better services.
In Japan, the sectional meetings between the Toyota National Dealers’ Advisory Council and Toyota are discussing after-sales service. Technical Sectional Meetings, which have been held regularly since 1977, investigate quality issues and serviceability from the customer’s perspective. At Service Meetings, held since 1990, various issues regarding the service sites of dealers are investigated. The results of both meetings are used to implement improvements.

Fundamental Approach

Today, when the world is faced by challenges that need to be addressed on a global scale, such as environmental problems and the spread of infectious diseases, and which are becoming increasingly severe, the raison d’etre of companies as members of the global community is in question.
For Toyota’s social contribution activities, it is time to take concrete actions from the perspective of “what we want to be like in the future.” We identified the areas that we will focus on to be a “harmonious society,” and for “human asset development*” and “community co-creation” to achieve the SDGs, and “Mobility for All,” which is Toyota’s aim. In these areas, we will contribute to establishing a global society in which everyone can live a rich and dynamic life. For the issues in each area, we all have a sense of ownership and take action on a genchi genbutsu (onsite
hands-on experience) basis. We will work together with our partners who share the same aspirations for the future in addressing issues that are difficult to solve solely by ourselves.
The origin of Toyota’s foundation is the aspiration to create happiness for people. We promote our corporate activities for the happiness of people other than ourselves through social contribution.
To facilitate the smooth functioning of various activities, the Corporate Citizenship Division, a specialized division for social contribution activities, plays the lead role in promoting activities in close cooperation with regional headquarters in the United States, Europe, Asia and China. Policies and approaches of the initiatives are reported to and discussed at the Sustainability Meeting.
*	Human asset development: Based on the belief that each individual is a being with diverse and essential potential, Toyota intends to develop such potential.

Toyota’s Social Contribution Activities which Started with Sakichi Toyoda’s Hope for People’s Happiness
Toyota’s social contribution activities trace their roots to Sakichi Toyoda, the father of Toyota Motor Corporation’s founder, Kiichiro Toyoda. In 1925, Sakichi pledged one million yen (at the time) to the Imperial Institute of Invention and Innovation to encourage battery- related inventions to support inventions that would enrich people’s lives. The invention of such batteries proved to be extremely difficult, and none have yet been completed. Nevertheless, the resulting progress in batteries for cars has had a tremendous impact on industries and people’s lives. Even after Sakichi’s death, this spirit was handed down to Kiichiro and others who started the automotive industry in Japan, through the desire to contribute to the development and welfare of the country and feelings of gratitude.
This spirit was later incorporated into the Five Main Principles of Toyoda.

Fundamental Approach

Toyota complies with local, national and international laws and regulations as well as the spirit thereof and we conduct our business operations with honesty and integrity. Furthermore, in order to contribute to sustainable development, we believe that management interacting with its stakeholders is of considerable importance, and we endeavor to build and maintain sound relationships with our stakeholders through open and fair communication.
Human Rights as an Essential Foundation of Labor Relations

 
Toyota respects the basic human rights of all individuals, including our employees and those in our supply chain. Toyota is a company that practices the philosophy of “Respect for People.” We share a common belief that every Toyota employee has the infinite capability to better themselves, the company, and society. The integration of such achievements by our employees will bring company growth. This growth allows our company to provide decent employment, which in turn, allows our members to build trust in the company and provide further productivity improvements.
Each employee’s contribution towards the creation of a work environment that promotes safety & health, respects each employee’s dignity, is inclusive, and that is free of discrimination and harassment is essential to ensuring a decent work environment, which will lead to the productivity improvement needed for company growth.
Discrimination, unhealthy, and unsafe work environments are not only violations of human rights, they are also conditions that will negatively impact employee performance. Since our employees spend a considerable amount of time at work we aim to create positive working conditions and environments that will allow them to excel.
In addition, the contributions and cooperation of all our stakeholders are essential to providing satisfying products and services to our customers.
 
We have continued manufacturing vehicles up to this point thanks to the support of many individuals. Going forward, we will continue to engage our employees and show respect to all of our stakeholders as we continue to contribute to society as a mobility company.
At present, with our customers’ needs and the very concept of automobiles constantly changing, Toyota is endeavoring to transform itself from an automobile company to a mobility company, that is, a company that provides all kinds of services related to people’s mobility. As we face new competitors and a changing business domain, Toyota’s employees are each harnessing their knowledge and giving their best efforts to survive in an environment marked by constant, major change, with Toyota’s management philosophy of “Respect for People” serving as the foundation. To meet the expectations of our stakeholders, we also refer to international norms such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to tackle issues related to human rights. The approach and progress of each initiative are reported to and discussed at the Sustainability Meeting.

Prioritized Human Rights Themes

 
Toyota continues to progress with due diligence activities guided by both internal policies and principles, as well as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In order to define our priorities, we have established a regular monitoring activity to grasp human rights-related concerns in society, and how Toyota can proactively tackle such concerns.
Due to the rising social concerns surrounding modern slavery, the enactment of legislation aimed at protecting the rights of migrant workers and the abolishment of child labor have been promoted in various countries. We have thus worked to gather information on these trends through dialogue with the Japan Council of Metalworkers’ Unions, ShareAction (through participation in the Workforce Disclosure Initiative), the Business for Social Responsibility Human Rights Working Group, the Global Alliance for Sustainable Supply Chain (“ASSC”), the International Organization of Employers (“IOE”), and the International Labor Organization (“ILO”). As a result, together with our business environment forecast, we decided to prioritize Migrant Workers and Responsible Sourcing of Cobalt as the main topics for FY2020. (Please refer to the link “Human Rights Due Diligence Report” for the detail on Migrant Workers)
Our aim is to partner with external stakeholders to fully understand and align with societal expectations, while also maintaining legal compliance in all of our operations and within our supply chain.

Migrant Workers

 
We recognize that migrant workers are vulnerable to situations of exploitation and forced labor. Due to the nature of Toyota’s business, we also recognize the possible risks of forced labor within our business and supply chain involving migrant workers.
As part of our due diligence activities, we have been working with non-governmental organizations to ensure fair working conditions for migrant workers within our affiliates and suppliers both inside and outside Japan. This has included the development of guidelines to help eliminate possible exploitation by unscrupulous employment agencies charging high recruitment fees, as well as ensuring freedom of movement, fair treatment, and proper employment contracts for migrant workers. (Please refer to the link “Human Rights Due Diligence Report”)
We have also partnered on the development of the “ASSC Tokyo Declaration 2020.” This is a set of 13 declarations created to enhance and respect the rights of migrant workers from the moment of recruitment, during overseas employment, and until their safe return to their home countries. The “ASSC Tokyo Declaration 2020” was developed with reference to the “Dhaka Principles,” regarded as the international norm advocated by the International Organization for Migration and the International Labor Organization.

 

 

Assessing Migrant Labor-Related Risks in Toyota’s Direct Global Operations
Toyota assesses migrant labor-related risks based on an understanding of the latest trends related to migrant labor and the expectations of stakeholders. We have created a task force to develop comprehensive surveys to grasp the current situation at Toyota subsidiaries both in Japan and overseas, specifically, to determine the number of migrant workers*, the countries the
workers migrated from, the percentage of indirect recruitment, and whether there were any possible issues in the recruitment and/or repatriation process (e.g., charging of recruitment fees, withholding of passports or identification documents, prohibition of return to the home country, etc.). Based on the data gathered, we have
 
determined that no infringements are being placed upon migrant workers at our subsidiaries.
*	In these surveys, “migrant workers” refer to non-regular (contingent, contract, non-permanent, temporary, etc.) foreign national workers with status of resi- dence (non-permanent) for the purpose of employment (excluding expatriates from other companies/countries).

Region	No. of Migrant Workers
Japan	600
Asia-Pacific	460
Europe	420
North America	57
Southern Africa	5
Latin America	0
Oceania	0
China	0
Due to the significant increase in the number of migrant workers being employed in Japan as a whole and within our domestic operations, we decided to investigate the situation of our Group companies and their major Tier-1 suppliers and our own major Tier- 1 suppliers (the top 276 suppliers accounting for 90% of the total procurement value) by focusing our attention on foreign technical internship trainees*, who are at high risk of debt bonded labor.
*	Foreign Technical Internship Trainees are foreign workers sent to Japan for the purpose of technical skills training. There are approximately 146 qualified job types, and trainees are dispatched to various industries in the hopes of providing much needed technical skills to be used in operations in their home countries upon repatriation.

Through our dialogue with our external stakeholders, we recognized that there is risk in hiring migrant workers from employment agencies in their sending countries and supervising organizations in Japan, since it may result in forced labor due to the migrant workers being charged exorbitant fees, ensnaring them in serious debt.
Through the surveys, we have been able to ascertain that 22 Tier- 1 supplier companies employ foreign technical internship trainees from affiliated companies, and 102 companies employ trainees via employment agencies in the sending country, and supervising organizations in Japan. Upon further investigation, we found that the countries dispatching technical internship trainees were mainly comprised of China and various South East Asian countries such as Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Indonesia.
In order to mitigate any possible human rights infringements associated with the migration of technical internship trainees, we plan to:
•	Promote corrective actions for zero tolerance of unreasonable fees borne by migrant workers that induce the possibility of forced labor
•	Work closely with suppliers to share best practices to avoid human rights infringements of migrant workers
•	Support supplier due diligence for agencies acquiring migrant workers in coordination with NGOs

Responsible Sourcing of Cobalt

 
Toyota recognizes the concern over cobalt sourcing from smallscale artisanal mining, which has been criticized for the utilization of child labor. We do not tolerate the use of child labor within our business and supply chain, and aim to implement measures to source only ethical cobalt.

Freedom of Association

 
In Toyota’s “Respect for People” management-philosophy, we aim to respect individual capabilities, ways of thinking, and creativity and harness them fully. To do this, it is necessary to make sure that all employees are on the same page regarding the company’s management situation, the surrounding environment, and management issues, and we emphasize thorough dialogue with employees. In addition, based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we respect our employees’ right to freely associate while also respecting their right not to be compelled to belong to an association in compliance with the laws of the countries in which we operate.
Regardless of whether or not there is a labor union, Toyota has taken every opportunity it can to engage in thorough dialogue with employees and build healthy labor relations. We believe that dialogue and discussion with employees or their appropriate representatives is part of these kinds of relationships between labor and management.
Moreover, to ascertain the status of dialogue with employees and issues related to freedom of association, we periodically send out and collect questionnaires from our subsidiaries and request that improvement be made to policies and activities based on the responses. For affiliates that require concentrated initiatives, associates from the Toyota Motor Corporation are dispatched to review policies and activities, and work with the affiliate in question to enhance communication with and training for employees regarding Toyota’s policies concerning freedom of association and legal compliance.
Toyota would like to highlight its activities to respect Freedom of Association of members within its supply chain. Between 2019 and 2020, as part of its global due diligence activities, Toyota investigated some cases of possible infringement on Freedom of Association within the supply chain and recommended corrective actions.
Unionization Situation
 
Along with the collective agreements in place with our unionized affiliate companies both in Japan and overseas, we also have Labor-Management Joint Declarations established in Japan (1962), Thailand (1993), Indonesia (2004) and Brazil (2015) as a global framework, in order to agree on a universal philosophy of labor relations.


Precarious Work

 
The term non-permanent workers refers to temporary workers, contract employees, dispatch employees, and so on. This status is marked by a number of uncertain and unstable characteristics, such as uncertain employment periods, low wages, and low employee benefits. Our businesses require personnel equipped with both a deep understanding of Toyota values and advanced skills, and because a long period of time is required to cultivate such personnel, Toyota strives to provide stable employment even when the external environment is harsh. At the same time, because it is engaged in the automobile industry, in which demand is greatly influenced by new products and seasonal factors, Toyota hires a certain number of temporary personnel for a certain period either directly or indirectly to respond to these fluctuations.
For this reason, in addition to each affiliate hiring non-permanent workers based on the customs and labor laws of each region, Toyota also strives to avoid inappropriate working conditions and employment.
First, we confirm the composition of employees at affiliates in various countries, and for non-permanent employment relationships, we identify affiliates requiring prioritized examination. Toyota Motor Corporation associates are dispatched to identified affiliate sites, and we implement improvements such as reallocations and reviews of employment rules related to contract terms when necessary. In addition, we review and continuously improve the working conditions of fixed-term contract employees at Toyota Motor Corporation.
 
Supply Chain Due Diligence

 
Automobiles are comprised of approximately 30,000 parts, and because the supply chain is extremely broad and deep, we are aware that preventing adverse impacts on human rights in our supply chain is a theme we should prioritize. So, we established a workshop for suppliers that are particularly large and difficult to replace in order to share incidents to be wary of and examples of problem solving.
Toyota adheres to the principle of mutual trust and mutual responsibility between labor and management and aims to collaborate with suppliers to contribute to sustainable societal development as well as the earth’s sustainability. It also strives to comply with the laws of various countries and regions while protecting human rights and performing activities that contribute to both local communities and the international community.


Covid-19 Pandemic Countermeasure Communication from Management to Members
 
We use our company intranet site to keep our members informed of the countermeasures the company has been implementing to address the latest Covid-19 related issues. Between February and September 2020, 15 separate communications regarding Covid-19 have been uploaded to the intranet site and delivered via line management. Information in these communications includes:
•	Mask, handwashing and gargling instructions
•	Social distancing protocols
•	Procedures for employees with Covid-19 related symptoms (including a health check-sheet)
•	Workplace disinfection

Within it, President Toyoda also issued a message related to Covid-19 for all global Toyota members.

Covid-19 Pandemic Countermeasure Collaboration with Union Representatives

 

 
Toyota has been utilizing its various communication channels with the Toyota Motor Workers’ Union to keep union members apprised of the countermeasures currently in place regarding Covid-19. The same channels have also been used to grasp the concerns and opinions of the members as they support the company in the implementation of such countermeasures. We have also been working with our Regional Headquarters to encourage them to utilize their communication channels to effectively relay Covid-19 safety- and health-related countermeasures and grasp union members’ concerns and opinions.
Some of the meetings held between Toyota management and the Toyota Motor Workers’ union can be found below:
•	Local Labor-Management Roundtable Conference of Workplaces (Once a month)
•	Local Labor-Management Roundtable Conference of Branches / Companies (Once a quarter)
•	Labor-Management Expanded Round Table Conference (Once every 2 months)
•	The Committee for HR system review (Once per week)
In the United States, we built consensus with all of our members and there was agreement to continue to work after the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. We also had dialogue with our union representatives at our unionized locations. Both the Teamsters Union and Longshoremen Union have been working closely with management to ensure a safe work environment with countermeasures including temperature checks, testing, social distancing, the wearing of masks, etc., while maintaining operations. The same actions have also been taken at Toyota’s non-unionized locations in the United States.
Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, numerous labor issues were successfully tackled with the support of the unions, and one Collective Bargaining Agreement was successfully negotiated with the Teamsters Union in 2020.
 
Education Related to Human Rights

Toyota invests in the education of our members and suppliers in relation to anti-discrimination, open and honest dialogue, as well as human rights related matters. Training is conducted both at Toyota Motor Corporation and affiliates in conjunction with our group companies and Tier 1 suppliers. Targets of the training include supplier executives, Toyota Motor Corporation managers who will be assigned to affiliates in various countries, and those in charge of purchasing at our overseas affiliates.

 
Participants gathered for training


Labor Relations Training for Supplier Executives

 
Labor relations training for suppliers is held about 10 times per year, primarily as preparation for executives from the head office of our main suppliers in Japan who are being transferred to overseas suppliers. At the training, a variety of areas are covered, including best practices for building positive labor-management relationships, information on past labor disputes, labor-management negotiations, and the latest trends in human rights, international norms, and regulations.
 
Training Prior to Being Transferred to Overseas Human Resources

 
All Toyota Motor Corporation employees who are being transferred to the human resources functions at affiliates in various countries receive this training so that they can understand the new roles for their overseas posting, the employment situation in the country, and the culture. Training includes lectures on labor-management relationships and human rights.
Training Prior to Being Transferred to Purchasing

 
All Toyota Motor Corporation employees who are being transferred to purchasing at affiliates in various countries receive this training to help support their daily purchasing responsibilities at their overseas posting. The training will involve lectures for building healthy labor-management relationships at local suppliers, including lectures related to human rights.

Initiatives for Responsible Mineral Sourcing
Concerns have been arising over risks in the procurement of minerals that are essential for manufacturing, including concerns about minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighboring countries (the Covered Countries) that may finance armed groups, and human rights abuses such as child labor, forced labor and mining in a harsh working environment.
In addition to the investigation and disclosure on the use of conflict minerals (gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten) in its products, which is required by the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Toyota has
also conducted investigation into the procurement of cobalt, which is associated with concerns over child labor and other

Toyota’s Policy for Responsible Mineral Sourcing
Based on the Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines, which compile Toyota’s requests to suppliers regarding their sustainability activities, Toyota has requested our suppliers to engage in responsible material procurement.
Also, in response to the spread of concerns over mineral sourcing in recent years, Toyota has established its Policies and Approaches to Responsible Mineral Sourcing, and has been implementing measures based on these policies.

















Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry
Toyota has conducted a reasonable country-of-origin inquiry with due diligence throughout its global supply chain since 2013. In 2019, Toyota again conducted a survey of its automotive, marine and other businesses in line with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-affected and High-risk Areas.
Before conducting the survey, Toyota formulated a manual detailing how to fill in the survey sheet and developed a tool, both of which were to be used by suppliers to compile the survey results. Toyota also supported a briefing session co-sponsored by the Japan Auto Parts Industries Association (JAPIA)*1 and the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA).*2 We contacted suppliers who had not submitted a Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), and collected CMRTs from thousands of suppliers.
We have reviewed the CMRTs and requested that the suppliers make corrections if there were any errors and/or omissions, in order to improve our efforts in relation to conflict minerals.
 
We are also making efforts to work with other industry groups on the issue of conflict minerals in Japan and overseas.
In cooperation with the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)*3, Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (TMNA), a
U.S. subsidiary of Toyota, has been engaging in the activities of Conflict-free Sourcing Working Group and the working group of the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG)*4 on conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo.Specifically, in 2019, TMNA continued to lead RMI’s Global Smelter Engagement Teams Working Group (as Team-Lead) in conducting background surveys of smelters/ refiners.
As a result of the industry-wide cooperation described above, the number of conflict-free smelters/refiners worldwide has increased to 267 as of November 2019. Of these, 265 companies are included in Toyota’s 2019 survey results.
The survey results from January–December 2019 and Toyota’s initiatives were incorporated into Form SD and the Conflict Minerals Report, and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 29, 2020.

Responsible Sourcing of Cobalt

 
Cobalt, used in batteries, etc. necessary for automobile electrification, is an important mineral resource for Toyota. At the same time, Toyota understands that there are concerns associated with mining of cobalt regarding child labor and other human rights abuses.
Toyota has formulated its Policies and Approaches to Responsible Mineral Sourcing based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-affected and High-risk Areas, and has promoted responsible procurement of minerals by such means as conducting surveys with the aim of enhancing the transparency of its supply chain.
Meanwhile, by participating in activities of the RMI Cobalt Working Group, Toyota’s U.S. subsidiaries have been encouraging smelters/refiners to acquire certificates.
Toyota has been advancing activities to clarify the supply chain and identify smelters using the Cobalt Reporting Template, or CRT*, provided by RMI. As of March 2020, the supply chain related to batteries, a major component using cobalt, has largely been clarified, with several smelters identified.
Toyota will continue to conduct background investigation of smelters, thereby identifying and assessing human rights risks including child labor. If any risk is identified as a result of the survey, we will develop appropriate measures to mitigate the risk.

Supply Chain
 

 
In order to contribute to society through car-manufacturing and monozukuri (manufacturing) and put into practice the principle of “Customer First,” it is necessary to share principles and collaborate with our business partners such as suppliers and dealers.
Toyota pursues open and fair business, and engages in sustainability initiatives through close collaboration with business partners to raise quality in terms of safety and customer satisfaction.

Safety and Peace of Mind	Enriching Lives of People
 
Since its establishment, Toyota has worked closely with its suppliers in its manufacturing. As part of these efforts, Toyota has globally implemented its Basic Purchasing Policies according to the spirit of mutual benefit based on mutual trust. We have close relationships with existing and new suppliers to promote “Customer First.”
To address the increasing interest in corporate social responsibility, including in our supply chain, we have dialogues with suppliers.
Before conducting business transactions, we conclude contracts that clearly spell out legal compliance, respect for human rights, and considerations for local and global environments. Internally, we work to raise the awareness of all our employees, including buyers, through seminars and trainings.

Toyota’s Supply Chain

 
Toyota has a total of 9,849 Tier-1 suppliers globally, including 3,605 parts suppliers.

Tier-1 Suppliers

	Parts	Equipment, logistics, etc.	Total
Global		3,605	6,244	9,849
	Japan	455	897	1,352
	Overseas	3,150	5,347	8,497
 
Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines
Toyota has issued the Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines, under which we cooperate with our suppliers. We share these guidelines with our suppliers and request suppliers to implement their activities based on the guidelines. In 2012, Toyota revised the guidelines to more clearly indicate its principles on human
rights issues (strengthening monitoring and corrective actions, and approaches towards conflict minerals) to help enhance its suppliers’ initiatives.
The Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines clearly indicate that Tier-1 suppliers are requested to deploy our purchasing policies and guidelines to their business partners in Tier-2 and beyond, so that the guidelines are disseminated and implemented throughout the entire supply chain.
We share the Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines globally. The guidelines are deployed to Toyota suppliers overseas through the purchasing departments of our overseas affiliates.

 
 
Initiatives for compliance and implementation
To ensure understanding and implementation of the guidelines, all Toyota suppliers are requested to periodically check the status of their implementation using a self-inspection sheet.
In 2020, around 350 Tier-1 suppliers, which account for over 90% of the purchase volume in Japan, submitted the results of their self inspection to show the status of their implementation. If any problem is reported from the outside, we investigate the fact. If we find that the problem is true, we ask the supplier in question to correct it while maintaining communication with the supplier
to ensure implementation of the correction, thereby preventing recurrence of the problem. Also, to prevent similar problems from occurring at other suppliers, we request them to pay attention
to the guidelines and ensure compliance. In 2020, for example, we requested correction of the treatment of foreign technical internship trainees who were unable to return to their home countries in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.
If an event violating the guidelines is found but no correction is made despite our request, we may reconsider our business relationship with the relevant supplier in principle.
Tier-1 suppliers are requested to ensure that Tier-2 suppliers act in the same way.
Sustainability Activities

 
Toyota conducts sustainability training for employees who are assigned to the purchasing department. Employees who are being transferred to a purchasing department overseas also receive labor relations training by the personnel affairs department before departure. This training prior to overseas transfer is offered also for suppliers to enable both Toyota and suppliers to share the same understanding for good labor relations communication.
Toyota works to support suppliers in promoting their own sustainability efforts, as well as collaborative sustainability initiatives between Toyota and suppliers.
In September 2020, to raise awareness of suppliers, Toyota

provided information for suppliers by video link on the web mainly on the themes below:

•	Initiatives to improve the environment
•	Foreign technical internship trainee system
•	Cyber security

For suppliers at Tier-2 and beyond, the contents of the training are communicated via Tier-1 suppliers, and thereby disseminated throughout the supply chain. Via its website, Toyota conducts questionnaire surveys on suppliers to listen to their opinions.
Suppliers voluntarily hold CSR lectures and workshops, and engage in volunteer activities.
CSR lectures are held every year by Toyota’s supplier associations, Kyohokai and Eihokai, with the aim of improving member companies’ awareness and understanding of sustainability, and encouraging sustainability initiatives.
In FY2020, a lecture titled “A business that starts from setting targets: Look ahead to the future with SDGs” was given by a guest lecturer.
CSR workshops are held voluntarily by suppliers with the aim of encouraging mutual learning through communication among
suppliers and enhancing understanding of sustainability initiatives.
 

 
CSR lecture


Human Rights and Due Diligence
Through communication with internal personnel affairs and IR departments and overseas affiliates as well as external organizations, and based on the results of self-inspection by
suppliers on compliance with the guidelines, Toyota continuously examines possible risks in each country and identifies the priority themes to be focused on. At present, foreign technical internship trainees in Japan and child labor in cobalt procurement are considered as priority risks that should be prevented.

Initiatives related to Foreign Technical Internship Trainees
 
Preventing Bribery

 
In response to the global expansion of its business and societal demands, Toyota has adopted the Anti-Bribery Guidelines to completely eliminate corruption. Toyota is strengthening its preventive measures by deploying the guidelines to its suppliers.

 


Responses to Non-compliance

 
Toyota makes daily efforts to maintain close communication with suppliers. We request suppliers to promptly provide information if any compliance-related problems arise. If any problem is reported from outside, we investigate the fact. If we find that the problem is true, we ask the supplier in question to correct it while maintaining communication with the supplier to ensure the implementation of the correction, thereby preventing any recurrence of the problem. If a serious non-compliance event, such as bribery, arises but no correction is made, we may reconsider our business relationship with the relevant supplier in principle.

Dealers

Dealers are the front line where Toyota’s “Customer First” policy is directly observed. Toyota and its dealers share the value of its products/services and always work as one to enhance customer satisfaction based on a strong relationship of trust through close two-way communication.
Toyota follows a “Customer First, Dealer Second, Manufacturer Third” concept. We support dealers in making concerted efforts to meet customer expectations and to raise the level of customer satisfaction. We believe that, through these efforts, we will realize growth for both dealers and Toyota.


Support for Toyota Dealers

The Toyota National Dealers’ Advisory Council (TNDAC), comprised of Toyota dealers in Japan, distributes the Legal Compliance Manual, a tool which explains major laws and regulations and summarizes the checkpoints to dealers, each year to help dealers carry out their voluntary compliance activities.
Additionally, Toyota supports TNDAC and dealers in many ways, including the following:
•	Setting up a compliance support website that lists best practices from dealers
•	Providing support for revising the Legal Compliance Manual in response to revisions in laws and regulations
 
Onsite Visit from Toyota Dealers Overseas
Every year, Toyota dealers throughout Japan host visits by Toyota dealers from all over the world who have expressed the desire to learn customer satisfaction (CS) activities.
They learn how Japanese dealers improve customer satisfaction and create more Toyota fans throughout the entire value chain, including new car sales, service, insurance, used cars and credit. After genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience), they incorporate what they have learned into various activities at their own locations back home. Through active communication among dealers with different cultural backgrounds, these visits offer each dealer new ideas and learning opportunities.

 
Visitors
 
Toyota Gentaiken Program

 
The Toyota Gentaiken Program aims to nurture future car fans by providing children of the “virtual era” with opportunities to gain real-life experience using their five senses and to experience the global environment and economy.
This program works together with local dealers to offer “traveling classrooms” at elementary schools in the area.
The theme of the classroom activities is to offer fun and hands-on experiences. The class for fourth graders teaches about the power and control of a car using a model and a real car in Car Gentaiken Class. The class for fifth graders provides a full understanding of cars, teaching the students about the relationship of cars to the environment and economics using quizzes or games, as part of learning about the automotive industry in their social studies class. In FY2020, the Car Gentaiken Class was conducted at 110 schools and the Class to Fully Understand Cars at 304 schools, for a total of 414 schools. Since starting in 2008, the program has provided classroom activities to approximately 200,000 children in 4,093 schools.

Building up Good Health

 
Aiming to raise the health level of all employees, Toyota has been promoting a company-wide initiative since 2017, promoting eight lifestyle habits that have an impact on the prevention of mental and physical diseases. This initiative, named Healthy Lifestyle Challenge 8*, is aimed at developing healthy people by defining the habits necessary to maintain health and encouraging each employee to adopt healthier habits or pay greater attention to the habits they have already adopted.
In order to revitalize workplace activities, regular feedback is provided on the results of the initiative at each workplace, while instructors visit workplaces to provide health lectures and instructions, evaluate the implementation level, and award workplaces in recognition of improvements made. Also, smartphone apps are made available that serve as barometers and visualize the level of implementation of the eight lifestyle habits, encouraging employees to participate enjoyably in the initiative.
* (1) Appropriate weight (BMI), (2) breakfast, (3) drinking, (4) snacking, (5) exercise, (6) smoking, (7) sleep, and (8) stress.

2019 targets and results

	Target	Result
Absentees due to lifestyle-related diseases	Down 5% from 2017	Down 3%
Absentees due to mental health problems	Down 10% from 2017	Down 2%
Average number of Challenge 8 habits practiced	6.5/8 items practiced by 2025	6.2/8 items practiced


Physical examination and health guidance

 
Physical examination targeting employees aged 40 or over includes a specialized examination aimed at prevention of lifestyle-related diseases and cancer screenings for early discovery of cancers. Based on the results of this examination, tailored health guidance is offered. In cases where no signs of improvement are seen in follow-ups or after hospital treatment, internal health guidance is also provided. In particular, the WELPO health support center, operated jointly by the Company and the health insurance society, accepts approx. 20,000 employees aged 36 years or older and their spouses (dependents) every four years, offering programs to support their health. For employees of other ages, physical examinations and various forms of health guidance are provided by full-time medical staff within their workplaces.
2019 targets and results
 
Initiatives for Mental Health Care

 
Employees, workplace managers, industrial health staff including psychology experts, and staff in charge of personnel and labor affairs are respectively engaged in various activities to prevent mental health problems from either occurring or recurring.
Toyota believes that promoting self-efforts to improve lifestyle habits (the Healthy Lifestyle Challenge 8 initiative) and developing a worker-friendly environment through workplace management are the basic actions in the primary stage of prevention. Since 2016, a stress check has been made available to all employees every year. The results of the check are notified to the employee, aimed at reminding them of their own stress condition. For employees who are potentially under high stress, face-to-face guidance by a physician is provided, thereby preventing aggravation of mental health problems. Furthermore, the results of group analysis are notified to each workplace, with the aim of assisting improvement of the workplace environment.
(2019 stress check implementation rate: 96.7%)
In the secondary stage of prevention, health consultation by full-time industrial physicians or public health nurses stationed at each office is provided to aid decision-making or offer follow-up support in response to concerns of or requests from employees and managers/supervisors.
As the third prevention stage, Toyota has prepared a program for supporting return to work, to enable careful treatment of the relevant employee based on the opinion of their main physician and the judgment of the industrial physician, as well as coordination of their workplace environment in accordance with the basic concept for returning to work. Through these initiatives, all offices are working to prevent recurrence and absence due to it.

Safety
Three Pillars of Safety

 
Under the basic policy of promoting the instillation and deepening of an interactive health and safety culture, Toyota promotes safety initiatives focusing on the three pillars of safety: people, work, and place/ environment. Toward achieving the target of “ultimately achieving zero accidents and the continuation of
 
zero accidents at all worksites,” Toyota promotes safety and health activities rooted in each worksite. These initiatives involve not only our employees but also secondees, assistant secondees, dispatched employees, employees of in-house contract companies, and employees of suppliers related to plant construction work, under the Occupational Safety and Health Rules.

Initiatives for the Three Pillars

[Safe “people”]
The key is the initiative by leaders who always demonstrate a safety-first attitude. Safety education programs are aimed at continuation of the development of safe-oriented human resources based on the history of hardships and efforts experienced by our predecessors, encouraging us to review our daily awareness and behavior.
[Safe “work” (risk management)]
 


 
Safety Memorial Center
 
Safety Risk Assessment

 
Cooperation with Overseas Affiliates
Toyota regional headquarters take the lead in promoting safety and health measures in each region. We are currently working with each region to develop an occupational safety and health management system (OSHMS*1) globally.
Globally common measures are basically implemented in accordance with ISO 45001*2 , with consideration given to issues unique to each region.
Using OSHMS, weaknesses are identified by genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience) inspections and audits, with the aim of improving the level of safety management.
 
The key to workplace safety is the 4Ss (seiri (sorting), seiton (straightening), seiso (cleaning), seiketsu (clean)), and the standardization of operations after listing up all operations and assessing the safety risks thereof, taking operability into consideration. In the case below, to avoid contact between a worker and an industrial vehicle, areas for people and vehicles are separated, thereby improving the level of safety.
 
We confirm whether measures are being implemented to avoid accidents that have occurred at other affiliates, and that a system has been created to ensure the effort is active and continuous.
Toyota also holds an annual global safety meeting, attended by managers from all regions who are responsible for safety and health, and who study measures to tackle common issues and can share information on best practices.

[Safe “place/environment” (heat countermeasures)]
The work environment, which is managed by statutory environmental measurement, is significantly affected by the production equipment, season and other factors. Therefore, measures for equipment are implemented according to the predetermined priority order. The following is a case aimed at improving the environment by creating flows of cool air throughout the worksite to mitigate heat.

Fundamental Approach	Social Recognition

 
Toyota’s strengths lie in our capacity to respect our employees’ abilities to think and promote reforms involving every member. Toward the transformation from a car company into a mobility company to leverage recent technical innovations centered on CASE, this capacity is growing increasingly important as we continue to create innovations steadily in existing areas while taking on challenges in new areas, and are required more than ever to provide products and services from diverse viewpoints of various members of society.
Amid such an environment, Toyota considers diversity and inclusion to be one of the key elements of our business infrastructure, and we are working to create an attractive workplace where employees with wide-ranging skills and values, irrespective of gender, age, nationality, race, ethnicity, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, marital status or the presence of children, can demonstrate their abilities to the fullest and achieve self-realization.
In order to become a company that is needed and chosen by society, we are promoting collaboration with a wide variety of partners both inside and outside the company while putting into practice the values Toyota has embraced since our founding, such as the attitude of humbly learning and taking on challenges from the customer’s viewpoint.
We are also implementing measures appropriate to individual regions globally throughout the entire global Toyota. In particular, we have set up dedicated diversity and inclusion promotion organizations in Toyota Motor Corporation (Japan), TMNA (U.S.), TMCA (Australia) and TSAM (South Africa). Additionally, in many regions we have established diversity and inclusion promotion organizations consisting mainly of concurrent appointments within the area of human resources. The direction/progress of these initiatives is discussed and reported at the Sustainability Meeting.

Toyota promotes various initiatives in the field of diversity and inclusion in each region. These initiatives have been appreciated and awarded by various external organizations and groups.

TMNA (North America)
In May 2020, TMNA won 10th place in the general division of the Top 50 Companies for Diversity 2020 ranking announced by U.S. Diversity Inc.

 

TMCA (Australia)
TMCA was selected as one of the Engagement & Enablement Winners in the Engaged Performance Awards 2019* hosted by Korn Ferry. TMCA is also registered as a WORK180 endorsed employer (an initiative that provides job applicants with a directory of employers who support women’s career development).
* Engaged Performance Awards 2019: Korn Ferry, a global organizational consulting firm, awards companies that have achieved excellent results in two categories of “engagement” (the level of employees’ commitment to their organizations and spontaneous efforts) and “enablement” (the level of work environments that enable employees to make good use of their skills and abilities and feel comfortable).

Women’s Participation in the Workplace

History of Initiatives

 
In promoting diversity and inclusion, we recognize that gender diversity has been an issue, particularly at Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan. In 2002, we started initiatives at Toyota Motor Corporation centered on expanding and establishing measures to support women who are trying to balance work and childcare. Then in 2012, we began focusing on initiatives for creating a work environment that would help women gain motivation and supporting their participation (especially development of female managers).

KPIs Related to Promoting Women’s Participation in the Workplace

 
Our initiatives to promote women’s participation in the workplace, which began in 2002, have resulted in continuous improvements of all KPIs, including the goals described in the action plan based on the Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace.
We will strive to improve the KPIs by continuing to implement initiatives to support female recruitment and participation.

Rank-specific Initiatives

We promote initiatives in all ranks, from development and expansion of next-generation human resources to securing diversity in top management.
 
Initiatives Related to Recruitment
For administrative and engineering positions, Toyota set the targets for the percentages of women in new graduates at 40% for administrative positions and 10% for engineering positions (the percentages of women in the relevant labor market), which have been achieved every year since 2015. The percentage of women hired as shop floor employees has also been steadily increasing.
 

 




Initiatives for Next-generation Development and Expansion (Toyota Female Engineer Development Foundation)
Toyota and nine group companies established the Toyota Female Engineer Development Foundation in December 2014 to contribute to the promotion of women’s participation in manufacturing businesses in Japan. The aim is to attract and expand the number of girls studying in scientific fields and foster female engineers in monozukuri (manufacturing). Our female engineers visit schools in Aichi Prefecture and give lectures to high school students to introduce them to engineering careers. The Foundation provides a development program for female engineering university students to support career building as well as a scholarship program that provides financial support.
 
Initiatives Related to Career Development Support
Toyota aims to support career development of female employees from a long-term perspective so that they can keep growing and play active roles while experiencing childbirth and childcare. In
2020, we formulated the Female Development Model based on cases of female employees who are actively working at Toyota. Based on this development model, we promote effective use of individual development plans with the aim of establishing an appropriate development environment and assigning the roles required at each stage: when working as a young employee before childbirth and when balancing work with childcare.
We have also introduced a career return system, which provides re-employment opportunities to employees who are forced to leave Toyota because of the job-related relocation of their spouse (regardless of the spouse’s gender or whether the spouse is a Toyota employee) or the need to provide nursing care, as well as a career continuation support system for Toyota employees who are moving with a spouse who is relocated overseas. The system enables them to continue their careers at their spouses’ overseas relocation destinations. Toyota thus has various systems to support diverse ways of career development.

Initiatives to Support Balancing Work and Childcare
Since 2015, Toyota has offered Pre-maternity Leave Seminars and Supervisor Career Interviews for employees who take maternity leave.
The goals of these events are to ease concerns about balancing work and childcare and to stimulate their desire to continue to develop their careers after returning to work. Participants examine their career plans and how best to achieve them, hear about other employees who have successfully balanced work with family commitments in the past and participate in roundtable discussions.
Toyota has also introduced a teleworking system, removing time and location restrictions, to allow employees to continue working while taking care of their children. The number of employees eligible for this system has been increasing, allowing a flexible workstyle for many of our employees, excluding employees at production sites.

[“Bubu Forest” Onsite Childcare Facility]
In April 2018, Bubu Forest was built on the headquarters site, and it is the fourth childcare facility, for 320 children.
To support shift workers at plants and nurses who work the night shift, Bubu Forest offers childcare in the early morning hours as well as overnight stays. It also offers shuttle service from nearby plants to pick up and deliver children. The facility also accepts new enrollments throughout the year to accommodate the needs of employees, including those who intend to return to work early after childbirth, mid-career employees and employees returning to Japan from overseas assignments.
In addition, Pipo Land, a new childcare facility established together with Bubu Forest within the Toyota Memorial Hospital, has also been opened to take in sick children. This childcare facility is available
to Toyota City residents and allows Toyota Motor Corporation to build stronger ties with the local community in support of promoting work-life balance and childcare.
 
Initiatives to Increase Numbers of Females in Managerial Positions
Toward achieving the target for 2025 (the number of females in managerial positions in 2014 to be increased fourfold by 2025), a new system has been established in which the plans and measures of each division are gathered by the personnel function and reported to the Sustainability Meeting, with the aim of accelerating company-wide initiatives. Development measures tailored to individual employees are also implemented at each workplace, including assigning a challenging role equivalent to a higher- rank position to candidates for promotion and appointing a mentor for management candidates or members immediately after promotion.
(As of FY2020, 2.5% of management positions are held by women in Toyota Motor Corporation. * The industry average is 2.2%.)


Development of Female Senior Professional/Senior Management Candidates
Since the number of females in senior professional/senior management positions is small at present, we develop candidates based on their succession plans and through hiring competent mid-career top women managers. The number of women in top management who have been promoted through internal development programs is also increasing.


Diversity in Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Toyota has appointed Directors from among a broad range of personnel based comprehensively on their past achievements and experience regardless of their gender, nationality or any other factors, with the aim of placing the right person in the right position.
We will maintain this principle and proactively appoint the right persons to the right posts in view of their roles and experience, focusing also on diversity.
As of December 2020, two of the total 15 members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board are women (13.3%).

Initiatives Related to Persons with Disabilities

 

Employment of Persons with Disabilities

 
We provide various work opportunities to people with disabilities based on the concept of a harmonious society in which all persons with or without disabilities work and live together in harmony. We offer a variety of support to enable people with disabilities to work energetically, utilizing their abilities to the full.
For example, we have assigned a job consultant to each office, created a consultation hotline that ensures privacy, and introduced a special holiday system that can be used by employees when going to hospital or other clinics. To ensure that people with disabilities are given fair opportunities, we send with them sign language interpreters, provide a variety of support tools and make workplace improvements as needed.
In terms of facility, we are creating workplaces with improved accessibility as needed by, for example, providing handicapped parking spaces and universally accessible toilets.
We are distributing guidebooks to those workplaces hiring employees with disabilities to help other employees better understand disabilities and gain the knowledge necessary to provide support.
In addition, to cultivate a workplace-wide ethos, we have implemented Emotional Barrier-free Training targeting a wide range of employees, from new employees to senior professionals/senior management, to promote understanding of and empathy for people with disabilities.
As of June 2020, the number of persons with disabilities employed was 1,368 accounting for 2.41 percent of the entire workforce (including special-purpose subsidiaries), which is above the legal requirement of 2.2 percent.
 
Creating a Work Environment “Toyota Loops”

 
Toyota Loops Corporation began operation in April 2009 with 28 people with disabilities and received certification from the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare as a special-purpose subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation in October of that year.
Toyota Loops primarily handles work that is outsourced from Toyota such as internal printing, mail services, enclosing catalogues and document digitization. It also performs a variety of office support tasks such as issuing visitor and employee identification cards and shredding documents, as well as erasing data from unneeded PCs. The company is also providing nursing assistance at the Toyota Memorial Hospital and healthcare services (massage) that can be used by Toyota employees.
As of June 2020, Toyota Loops employed 289 persons with disabilities. The number of support staff has also been increased to eliminate or reduce any anxieties that employees may have regarding their health or work. We are also reinforcing support by creating a consultation hotline and providing consultations with an industrial physician and counseling by a clinical psychologist and psychiatrist. We actively exchange information with governmental bodies, local communities and social welfare organizations to create working environments where each employee can work with reassurance.
We also have many employees who are active outside work. Toyota Loops employees representing Aichi Prefecture participated in the Abilympics (a national technical skills competition for people
with disabilities), winning silver in the Database division and bronze in the Word Processor division in 2018, and bronze in the Office Assistant division in 2019.

Toyota Loops Employees Participating in Development

 
As a form of work and contribution uniquely available to people with disabilities, some of the Toyota Loops employees participate in the development of assisted mobility vehicles. For example, they have participated in evaluations (evaluating ease of getting in and out with a wheelchair) for development of the Welcab and provided opinions on aspects of the development of automated driving vehicles.
[Evaluation of assisted mobility vehicles]
Employees with disabilities participate in evaluations of the usability of Toyota’s assisted mobility vehicles from the users’ viewpoint.
Based on this evaluation, opinions of real users, including the small details that only users can notice, can be reflected in the quality of the vehicles.

Visiting a school for special needs education
As part of our community contribution, some Toyota employees visited a school for special needs education to hold a class for students with disabilities. In the class, students experienced preparatory operations before assembly, using some engine parts that will be actually installed in real vehicles.


Initiatives at Major Global Operations

 
We are striving to create a workplace environment that is friendly even to employees with disabilities by, for example, providing universally accessible toilets, handicapped parking spaces and wheelchair ramps. We also conduct a variety of events, for example participating in campaigns and holding workshops, to promote public understanding about people with disabilities.

TDEM (Thailand)
Together with organizations serving people with disabilities, we are carrying out activities to promote safe driving, including holding seminars with the goal of increasing knowledge and awareness about safe driving.

We also have a special program to provide additional financial support to persons with disabilities for vehicle costs (to cover the increased cost associated with owning a special vehicle).


LGBT

LGBT-related Initiatives

 
Toyota has launched initiatives with the aim of creating workplaces with an appropriate understanding and acceptance of LGBT people. At Toyota Motor Corporation, prohibition on discrimination or harassment of LGBT people has been incorporated into the employee behavioral guidelines, and we no longer require new graduates to fill in their gender on their job application sheets. We have been introducing measures related to facilities, such as establishing an internal harassment consultation hotline and allocating dedicated toilets for LGBT people at Head Office and the Nagoya office. Starting from July 2020, we have introduced revised internal systems to allow employees in same-sex marriages or common-law marriages to use the same internal benefit systems as those in legal marriages (holidays, employee benefits, etc.). In terms of corporate culture, in addition to the internal training programs to
 
enlighten new graduate employees about human rights and experience-based training by outside instructors (LGBT people) for mid-career employees, we require all employees and officers to receive an education program on basic knowledge about LGBT. Toyota also started registration for ALLY*. As of November 2020, around 20,000 employees have been registered as ALLYs.
* ALLY: An Ally is a person who is not LGBT but understands and supports LGBT and other sexual minorities.

TMNA (U.S.)
During the recruiting and hiring process, we provide a nondiscrimination statement to everyone that submits a job application. That statement says that the company does not discriminate based on gender, ethnicity and other categories, including LGBT. We do not require a photo or gender identification on resumes. One of our business partner groups (organizations representing minority’s interest) is an LGBT group conducting education and enlightenment activities. Most of our operation sites have gender-neutral toilets. We also promote activities focusing on increasing the number of ALLY members.

Following the introduction of the Internal Re-employment Program for Retired Professionals in 1991, an Optional Re-employment Application System was launched in 2001 to outplace applicants to external affiliates and other sites, providing a framework for helping over 60s to continue working.
Based on the revisions to the Law on Stabilization of Employment of Elderly Persons in 2006 and 2013, the support was revised to expand re-employment by taking surveys and interviews based on the needs of the employees.
In addition, starting from 2016, the Advanced Skilled Partner System

Fundamental Approach
Toward achieving transformation into a mobility company, Toyota is committed to both “realizing advanced monozukuri (manufacturing) with higher quality and efficiency based on TPS” and “taking on challenges in new areas.” To this end, Toyota encourages its employees to review their workstyles and hone their individual abilities, thereby enhancing the workplace structures.
Toyota also seeks human resources equipped with both the ability to act and compassion*, and promotes recruitment, training and evaluation of employees based on these abilities. In this process, Toyota identifies the roles and abilities of each individual, ensuring the placement of the right person in the right position regardless of their nationality, gender, year of joining Toyota, form of recruitment, academic background, job type and other factors, with the aim of enhancing the competitiveness of the company and its organizations.
*Compassion: The ability to make efforts for others, such as customers and teammates, and the ability to learn respectfully from others and keep improving
 
4.	Course-specific recruitment of new graduates
•	To accelerate development of professional human resources, hire students who have a concrete vision of what they want to do at Toyota and determine the course they will be assigned to at the time of recruitment, to ensure recruitment of diverse human resources suited to the characteristics of specific workplaces, such as with IT-related personnel.

Evaluation of and Feedback to Employees
Daily work (topics and roles) of Toyota employees are derived from annual direction. Evaluation and feedback are based on close communications between subordinates and superiors.
Specifically, topics and roles are determined at the beginning of each fiscal year and employees consult with their supervisors periodically. Through these consultations, supervisors assess the employees’
self-evaluations and provide feedback. Repeating this cycle leads to human resource development. Results for each half year are reflected in bonuses and performance abilities demonstrated over the past year are reflected in salary raises for the following year.
 
Recruitment	Education / Career Development
To hire the desired persons, Toyota has revised its conventional recruitment course as follows:
 
1.	Recruitment criteria
•	To accelerate the introduction of workstyles based on teamwork and alliances in preparation for the launch of mobility services, recruit more people who are attractive for other employees to work with.
•	Place greater emphasis in recruitment on compassion and the passion to realize their dream at Toyota.
2.	Enhancing mid-career recruitment
•	To introduce external knowledge and promote revision of work processes and workstyles, increase mid-career hires from 10% (new graduates accounting for 90%) to 30% (FY2020 result).The medium- term goal is to increase mid-career hires to 50%.(Administrative and engineering employees)
•	Introduce referrals (introduction by Toyota employees) and other new means of recruitment.
3.	Hiring new graduates with diverse backgrounds
•	To ensure diversity in human resources, hire persons with compassion who passionately want to work at Toyota regardless of their school or academic background.
•	Promote recruitment of diverse people from universities from which no graduates have been hired by Toyota, technical colleges, vocational schools and high schools.
 
Global Human Resource Development Structures

 
To develop human resources capable of implementing the Toyota Philosophy globally, Toyota is providing training through global executive human resource development, Toyota Motor Corporation(TMC) human resource development undertaken by Toyota Motor Corporation, and overseas affiliate human resource development undertaken by affiliates in each region.

Global Executive Human Resource Development
The Global 21 Program is to provide skilled global employees with knowledge suitable for global Toyota executives and to exercise their strengths to the best of their ability in their respective areas of responsibility. The program comprises the following three pillars.
1.	Indication of management philosophy and expectations of executives
Disseminating Toyota Philosophy and incorporating it into global human resource system and training.
2.	Human resource management
Applying appropriate personnel evaluation standards and processes in each region based on Toyota’s common values
3.	Training deployment and training programs
Global assignments and executive training are carried out.
Development of human resources at overseas affiliates is based on local training together with OJT at Toyota Motor Corporation to learn Toyota ways of performing work.
TMC human resource development includes programs corresponding to Global 21 within the Toyota Motor Corporation training system.


TMC Human Resource Development

 
Management Human Resource Development
All personnel who are promoted to senior professional/senior management or professional/management undergo one-year, rank-specific training. Officers and general manager-class employees serve as instructors for group training and seminars that include discussions in small groups, with the aim of strengthening a culture of learning and teaching. To enhance workplace capabilities, training programs for managers and training for performance reviewers to improve their evaluation and feedback skills are offered.
To develop executive human resources candidates, Toyota encourages the promotion of young employees to important positions. This creates opportunities for top management to directly observe personnel in these positions and to foster executive minds in the candidates.
 
Dispatch Program for Young Employees
The dispatch program for young employees overseas was expanded from 2014 to accelerate the early development of young employees.
Employees working for more than four years are dispatched to overseas affiliates, overseas graduate programs (including MBA programs), or domestic affiliates for one to two years. Their mission is to acquire practical skills, deepen their understanding of different cultures, and improve their language skills. In 2019, 371 employees were dispatched.

Shop Floor Employee Human Resource Development
OJT is conducted by supervisors and superiors at worksites. Focus is placed on the cycle of clarification of goals, formulation of development plans, assignment for development, and evaluation/feedback.
Programs include OFF-JT, including rank-specific training and training for managers/supervisors, as well as OJT and OFF-JT combined for acquiring knowledge and technical skills. Web learning programs have also been enhanced to support employees in their voluntary learning.
The workplace environment is changing with a declining birth rate and aging population, a shrinking workforce and diversification of worksite members. It is necessary for worksite members to maximize results to maintain production. Specifically, we take measures to support diverse employees, including those who return to work until 65 after retirement at age 60 and increasing female shop floor employees. In order to respond flexibly to new technologies and changes in production systems, we specify evaluation down to the technical element unit. Start-up seminars are also held to support transferred employees in efficiently acquiring work skills.

Overseas Affiliate Human Resource Development

 
With the goal of promoting self-sufficiency in overseas affiliates, we temporarily transfer employees from overseas affiliates to Toyota Motor Corporation for OJT. Transferees focus on learning skills, knowhow, and Toyota’s way of thinking and work processes throughout their training period, which is from six months to three years. Executives are posted as general managers or department managers at Toyota Motor Corporation to learn about decision-making processes and to form networks with other employees.
 

Administrative and Engineering Human Resource Development
OJT focuses on genchi genbutsu (onsite, hands-on experience), while off-the-job training (OFF-JT) opportunities for growth are also created with the guidance of supervisors or superiors. For six months after hiring, new employees learn basic knowledge of various areas in group training (Off-JT), and basic skills of Toyota persons in training at dealers and plants. After being assigned to respective workplaces, employees undergo OJT human resource development programs based on genchi-genbutsu. Group training (Off-JT) is also provided for young and mid-career employees in the third and sixth to eighth years of employment.

Results of Employee Satisfaction Survey	Flexible Workstyle
 

By providing its employees with opportunities to be involved in social contribution and self-realization through their work, Toyota aims to help all employees to exercise their abilities to think, to be creative, and to perform. Toyota uses its employee satisfaction surveys to measure the results of these efforts and utilizes the analysis results for planning and implementing measures to make a better workplace.

Toyota promotes flexible workstyles without restrictions of time and location, with a view to improving productivity and supporting employees in balancing work with childcare/family care.
At administrative and engineering workplaces, the Free Time & Location (FTL) system, which enables employees to telework, was introduced in 2016. At production sites, where teleworking is difficult, a system for reduced working hours has been enhanced to support balancing work with childcare/nursing care.
Due to the spread of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus, Toyota temporarily expanded the range of qualifications and job types eligible for teleworking. Toyota has decided to continue this permanently from September 2020, allowing more flexible workstyles.

Corporate Governance


 
Fundamental Approach
Toyota regards sustainable growth and the stable, long-term enhancement of corporate value as essential management priorities. Building positive relationships with all stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, business partners, local communities and employees, and consistently providing products that satisfy customers are key to addressing these priorities. To this end, Toyota constantly seeks to enhance corporate governance.

Business Execution and Supervision
 
they arise and to strengthen their development as part of a diverse and talented workforce through genchi genbutsu (on-site learning and problem-solving).
In April 2020, Toyota consolidated the post of executive vice president and the post of operating officer into the post of operating officer. With the posts of executive vice president and operating officer consolidated, all operating officers will have equal power and will serve as chief officers, presidents of in-house companies, regional CEOs or persons in charge of various functions, with each role to be further clarified. Such roles are not fixed so as to allow the right people to take on responsibilities where and as needed. In July 2020, Toyota announced a revision of the executive structure aimed at pressing forward with structural reform and further clarifying the roles of its operating officers.
 

Corporate Governance Organization

 
Contributing to society through monozukuri (manufacturing) is the basis of Toyota’s corporate value. To enhance its corporate value in the medium- to long-term, it is appropriate for Toyota to be a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board, where internal executives who have been long engaged in and have deep knowledge of manufacturing, and outside executives who are capable of providing advice for the creation of new value from a broad perspective, can participate in well-balanced decision making at the Board of Directors’ meetings.
With respect to its framework for executing its operations, Toyota, with the aim of realizing the Toyota Global Vision, has been continuing its efforts to respond swiftly to the external environment, which is changing faster than ever. Following the introduction of “region-based management” in 2011, the “business unit system” in 2013, and the “in-house company system” in 2016, in 2017, Toyota further clarified that Members of the Board of Directors are responsible for decision-making and management oversight and that operating officers are responsible for operational execution for purposes of further accelerating decision-making and operational execution.
Furthermore, in 2018, Toyota brought forward the timing of executive changes from April, when it used to take place, to January, in order to further accelerate management oversight that is fully coordinated with the workplace. In addition, Toyota transformed the company structure into one that enables decision-making that is both close to the needs of customers and close to where the action takes place, by taking measures such as reviewing the corporate strategy function and restructuring the Japan Sales Business Group into a group based by regions rather than sales channels.
In 2019, to further advance its “acceleration of management” and the development of a diverse and talented workforce, Toyota made executive and organizational changes as follows.
•	Executives are composed of only senior managing officers and people of higher rank.
•	A new classification called "senior professional/senior management" (kanbushoku in Japanese) grouped and replaced the following titles or ranks: managing officers, executive general managers, (sub-executive managerial level) senior grade 1 and senior grade 2 managers, and grand masters. From the perspective of appointing the right people to the right positions, senior professionals/senior management are positioned in a wide range of posts, from those of chief officer, deputy chief officer, plant general manager, senior general manager to group manager, regardless of age or length of employment, to deal with management issues as

Corporate Governance Organizational Diagram	Members of Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board
Board of Directors and Related Structures
With respect to the system regarding Members of the Board of Directors, Toyota has comprehensively considered and appointed the right person for the right position to make appropriate and prompt decision- making. Toyota believes that it is critical to appoint individuals who comprehend and are capable of putting into practice the “Five Main Principles of Toyoda”, which set forth our founding philosophy, and contribute to decision-making aimed at sustainable growth into the future. Moreover, these individuals should be able to play a significant role in transforming Toyota into a “mobility company” through responding to social transformation by using CASE* and external partnerships based on trust and friendship and internal
two-way interactive teamwork. The Board of Directors should consist of members who have abundant knowledge, deep insight and the highly professional expertise needed by Toyota and members appointed with consideration for diversity. Members of the Executive Appointment Meeting, of which the majority are Outside Directors, discuss recommendations with the Board of Directors regarding such appointments. Furthermore, three Outside Members of the Board of Directors have been appointed in order to adequately reflect the opinions of those from outside the company in management’s decision-making process, and all of them are registered as independent officer with the relevant financial instruments exchanges.
Toyota considers the appointment of Outside Members of the Board of Directors as independent officers in accordance with the requirements for Outside Members of the Board of Directors set out in the Companies Act and independence standards established by the relevant financial instruments exchanges.
Outside Members of the Board of Directors provide advice in Toyota’s management decision-making process based on their broad experience and insight, independently from the management structure.
To allow the insight of Outside Members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board to be fully made use of, Toyota has launched the following measures:
(1)	Review the criteria for submission of proposals to the Board of Directors as needed to reduce the number of proposals submitted, so that sufficient time can be secured to discuss each proposal.
(2)	Provide an explanation of all proposals in advance to help understand the background of the proposal.
(3)	Remove the time limit for discussions at Board of Directors’ meetings to ensure sufficient discussion can be held.
(4)	Besides the Board of Directors meetings, set periodic opportunities for two-way communication between Outside Members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board and the operational execution side on important management issues and medium-to long-term issues.
In recent years, to facilitate active discussion at Board of Directors’ meetings, Toyota has reduced the number of members (Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members) of the Board of Directors’ Meeting (from 34 in 2010 to 15 in 2020). As a result, opportunities for each member to speak at Board of Directors’ meetings have increased, enabling Outside Members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board to speak on almost all proposals.

Personnel Structure of the Board of Directors	Audit & Supervisory Board
Toyota has adopted an Audit & Supervisory Board system. Six Audit & Supervisory Board Members (including three Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members) play a key role in Toyota’s corporate governance by undertaking audits in line with the audit policies and plans.
 






















Overview of the Executive Appointment Meeting
 
Chairman of the Board
 
100%
 
In appointing Audit & Supervisory Board Members, Toyota believes it is necessary to elect individuals who have broad experience and insight in their respective fields of expertise and can advise management from a fair and neutral perspective, as well as audit the execution of business. Toyota’s Executive Appointment Meeting, more than half of whose members are Outside Directors, discusses recommendations to the Audit & Supervisory Board regarding such appointments.
Three individuals, all of whom are registered as independent officers with the relevant financial instrument exchanges, have been appointed as Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members. When appointing Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, Toyota considers the requirements set out in the Companies Act as well as the independence standards established by the relevant financial instrument exchanges. In recent years, the Audit & Supervisory Board and the internal audit function have been strengthening their ties by increasing the opportunities to share their audit results, with the aim of improving the effectiveness of their audits.
Analysis and Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
 	
After the Secretariat of the Board of Directors conducts a quantitative analysis of the state of the Board’s performance pursuant to an instruction of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, a survey is conducted of Members of the Board of Directors (Members of the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members) regarding the state of execution of operations and of the supervision of such execution.
Furthermore, interviews are held individually with Members of the Board of Directors, including the Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, based on results of the survey. The Secretariat of the Board of Directors’ Meeting combines and explains the findings to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and reports and discusses the findings at the Board of Directors’ Meeting.
The evaluation for FY2020 confirmed the effectiveness of Meetings now that sufficient information concerning proposals submitted to the Meetings was provided in advance for members, including Outside Directors. This has enabled members to actively raise questions and answers and exchange opinions at Board of Directors’ Meetings from a broad perspective with a view to enhancing the corporate value in the medium- to long-term.
Toyota will continue to conduct evaluations of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors and make improvements to further enhance their effectiveness.
Training for Members of the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members

 
In order to ensure that Outside Members of the Board of Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members understand Toyota’s philosophy and efforts, Toyota arranges on-site inspections, including at its subsidiaries, and other opportunities. Also, as explained above, besides the Board of Directors Meetings we offer opportunities to help deepen their understanding, such as advance explanations on proposals submitted to the meetings and two-way communication with the operational executive on important management issues and medium- to long-term issues.

Executive Compensation

 
The amount of executive compensation, how its calculation method is determined, and the calculation method are described below.

Decision Policy and Decision Process
Toyota believes that it is critical to appoint individuals who comprehend and are capable of putting into practice the “Five Main Principles of Toyoda,” which set out our founding philosophy, and contribute to decision making aimed at sustainable growth into the future. Moreover, these individuals should be able to play a significant role in transforming Toyota into a “mobility company” by responding to social transformation using CASE and external partnerships based on trust and friendship and internal two-way interactive teamwork. The director compensation system is an important means through which to promote various initiatives and is determined based on the following policy.
•	It should be a system that encourages Members of the Board of Directors to work to improve the medium- to long-term corporate value.
•	It should be a system that can maintain compensation levels that will allow Toyota to secure and retain talented personnel.
•	It should be a system that motivates Members of the Board of Directors to foster management from the same viewpoint as our shareholders with a stronger sense of responsibility as corporate managers.
Remuneration for Members of the Board of Directors is effectively linked to corporate performance while reflecting individual job responsibilities and performance. Remuneration standards in each member’s home country are also taken into account when determining remuneration amounts and methods. Remuneration for Outside Members of the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members consists only of fixed payments. As a result, this remuneration is not readily impacted by business performance, helping to ensure independence from management.
The remuneration for the Company’s Members of the Board of Directors and the remuneration system are decided by the Board of Directors and the “Executive Compensation Meeting,” a majority of the members of which are Outside Members of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors resolves the total amount of remuneration for a given fiscal year and delegates determination of the amount of remuneration for each Member of the Board of Directors to the Executive Compensation Meeting.
The Executive Compensation Meeting reviews the remuneration system for Members of the Board of Directors and senior management and determines the amount of remuneration for each Member of the Board of Directors, taking into account factors such as corporate performance as well as individual job responsibilities and performance.
Remuneration for Audit & Supervisory Board Members is determined by the Audit & Supervisory Board within the scope determined by a resolution of the shareholders’ meeting.
To decide the compensation for the fiscal year under review, the Executive Compensation Meeting was held three times in April 2019, March 2020 and April 2020. Also, advanced meetings attended solely by Outside Directors was held five times in August, September, October and December 2019 and February 2020 to hold discussions in preparation for the Executive Compensation Meeting.
The compensation for the Members of the Board of Directors was decided with the agreement of all members of the Executive Compensation Meeting.

Method of Determining Performance-based Remuneration
1)	Directors with Japanese citizenship (excluding Outside Directors)
Toyota sets the total amount of remuneration (Annual Total Remuneration) received by each Member of the Board of Directors in a year based on consolidated operating income, the volatility of the share price of Toyota and individual performance evaluation. The balance after deducting fixed remuneration from Annual Total Remuneration constitutes performance-based remuneration.

Toyota sets an appropriate executive compensation level for the Annual Total Remuneration based on position and duties by referencing a benchmark group of companies located in Japan.

Internal Control
Toyota, together with its subsidiaries, has created and maintained a sound corporate climate. Toyota integrates the principles of problem identification and continuous improvement into its business operation process and makes continuous efforts to train employees who will put these principles into practice.
Toyota has endeavored to establish a system for ensuring the appropriateness of business operations as a corporate group and the proper implementation of that system in accordance with the “Basic Policies on Establishing Internal Controls.” Each business year, Toyota inspects the establishment and implementation of internal controls to confirm that the organizational units responsible for implementing internal controls are functioning autonomously and are enhancing internal controls as necessary.

Initiatives for Risk Management

Organizational Structure
 
“mobility company,” Toyota is always taking on new challenges, and	 	
 
has been working to reinforce its risk management structure to handle the increasing uncertainty.
Toyota has appointed a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and Deputy Chief Risk Officer (DCRO), making global efforts to prevent and mitigate the impact of risks that could arise in Toyota’s global business activities.
 
Beneath the CRO and DCRO are Regional CROs appointed to manage their own risk management structures.
Within head office departments (such as Accounting and Purchasing), risk management by function is assigned to chief officers and risk managers of individual divisions, while in individual in-house companies, risk management by product is assigned to the company presidents and risk managers of individual divisions. This makes it possible for them to coordinate and cooperate with the regional head offices and sections.
In addition, significant risks requiring quick response will be reported by CRO and DCRO and discussed in the board meeting and/or other needed management meetings.
To oversee and mitigate global risks, we are continually enhancing and evolving our global risk management capability. On the strong foundation of the Toyota Global Risk Management Standard (TGRS), which defines, based on the ISO and COSO (Committee for Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) Enterprise Risk Management frameworks, Toyota’s globally common risk management policy, structure, and operating procedures, we are well-positioned to develop a strong global risk management discipline.
 



Noted Risk
To respond to emerging risks in recent years, Toyota has advanced measures related to business continuity management (BCM) to secure safety operations in Headquarters, group companies, and business partners during the coronavirus pandemic and cyber security risk.

Business Continuity Management (BCM)
Although Toyota was not directly affected by large-scale disasters such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Thailand floods, our production operations stopped for a long period of time, which inconvenienced our customers in terms of both sales and services.
There are deep concerns about the possibility of a massive Nankai Trough earthquake occurring, and the Toyota Group companies’ main functions are concentrated in that area. It is predicted that a large-scale earthquake there would severely impact our production and logistics operations.
To be prepared for such disasters, the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) was established to facilitate early recovery of business operations despite limitations on resources.
To continue to contribute to
 
Humanitarian Aid and Early Recovery for Disaster-affected Regions

 
Toyota has concluded comprehensive disaster support agreements with local governments (Toyota City, Miyoshi City, Tahara City, Hekinan City, and Susono City). In accordance with the Basic Guidelines, these efforts will give priority to disaster recovery and contribute to building disaster-resilient communities.
Humanitarian support and regional recovery assistance are to be provided under mutual cooperation with local governments. Toyota is preparing relevant structures by incorporating necessary provisions in its BCP and conducting joint training with the local governments.
Details of the major support items are described below. In addition, we have agreed with individual local governments to provide support, such as allocating designated shelter facilities.
 
enriching the lives of communities, Toyota will work on disaster recovery following the Basic Guidelines.
 
Toyota’s Basic Guidelines (Priorities during a Disaster)
 


 
Business Continuity Management at Toyota
PDCA is implemented and continuous improvements are undertaken through training and other means to constantly raise the practical effectiveness of Toyota’s BCP.
These activities are identified as Business Continuity Management (BCM), promoted through coordination among employees and their families, Toyota Group companies and suppliers and Toyota.
Through this process of formulation and review of BCP, we aim to develop risk-resilient organizations, workplaces and individuals.
 

Building a Disaster-resilient Supply Chain

 
Toyota provides recovery support with the following priorities: (1) Humanitarian aid; (2) Early recovery of the affected area; (3) Restoration of Toyota’s operations and production. Since the Great East Japan Earthquake, we have worked with suppliers in each country and region to build a disaster-resilient supply chain by sharing supply chain information and setting up measures for prompt initial action and early recovery.
In sharing supply chain information in Japan, Toyota has received highly confidential information from suppliers and used it to build a database, the RESCUE (REinforce Supply Chain Under Emergency) system, based on the concept of protecting Japanese monozukuri (manufacturing). While strictly protecting suppliers’ confidential information, Toyota conducts regular training with suppliers to ensure effective utilization of this system in the event of a disaster.
This system has been standardized and shared with other companies through the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, thus helping to build a disaster-resilient supply chain.
Toyota is implementing equivalent initiatives with suppliers in each country and region overseas.

Initiatives for Information Security

 

Response to Infectious Diseases

 
Toyota positions preventing the spread of COVID-19 novel coronavirus and responding properly to the occurrence of infection as an urgent issue and is working to address this issue in view of the impact not only on its own business activities but also on society.
First, under the principle of placing the highest priority on the safety and security of our employees and their families, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders, we set up the emergency headquarters at the end of January 2020, in the early stages of the spread in Japan, to discuss measures to prevent infection.
Headquarters makes decisions on various responsive actions based on environmental changes and implements them in line with the instructions of the governments of Japan and other countries/regions. In preparation for any employee or anyone working with us being infected, a manual that indicates where to report the infection and the method of disinfection is distributed to all workplaces.
Additionally, to prevent the spread of infection and support frontline medical workers, we are considering implementing various measures that make effective use of our manufacturing and logistics know-how and the global supply chains of the automobile industry. Company-wide measures are controlled flexibly by internal headquarters members, including management, while each workplace implements its own voluntary initiatives.
Second, as there are concerns about the medium- to long-term impact on economic activities, it is also necessary to continue our business operations by taking all measures to prevent infection and make preparations for economic recovery after the situation settles down. While protecting employment, we will promote flexible manufacturing and advanced workstyle reform, such as increasing teleworking at home, as our own structural improvements. Through such efforts, we believe that the automobile industry, a core
 
Information Security Policy

 
With cyber attacks becoming more sophisticated and complicated, the targets of cyber attack are no longer limited to confidential information and information systems, but also include the networks of systems that control plant facilities and vehicles (such as on-board device systems). The importance of information security is increasing for Toyota.
Toyota is committed to ensuring the safety and security of our customers from cyber attack threats and we consider it our social responsibility to protect our customers’ personal information.
Therefore, we are reinforcing information security by governance and risk management based on the Information Security Policy, formulated to clearly define our basic policy and attitude regarding information security, with the goal of taking necessary actions together with our subsidiaries.

Organizational Structure
Under the Chief Information & Security Officer (CISO), security officers are assigned to the individual security fields to promote activities.
Details of activities in each security field and overall common issues are shared and discussed at Information Security Management Meetings to improve information security throughout Toyota. If a serious incident occurs, the facts of the incident are promptly confirmed and reported to management, including Board of Directors. Causes of the incident are analyzed and countermeasures are taken.
 
Initiatives for Information Management

 
Toyota has established the All Toyota Security Guidelines (ATSG) covering Toyota Motor Corporation, our subsidiaries and affiliates with the goal of comprehensively preventing information leaks and emerging risks of cyber attacks.
Based on ISO 27001/27002, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, and the Cybersecurity Management Guidelines by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, ATSG ensures information security through a multi-faced approach: through organization, human resources, technical security, physical security and incident/accident response. To cope with recent environmental changes and increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks, ATSG is revised periodically.
By annually inspecting the information security initiatives being taken at each company in line with ATSG, Toyota is working to ensure continuous maintenance and improvement of their information security.
Furthermore, starting in FY2019, Toyota Motor Corporation has been carrying out on-site inspection of all of our consolidated subsidiaries (to check responses to ATSG and the status of implementation of physical security measures at each company).

In terms of automobile-related initiatives, Toyota is a member of the Automotive Information Sharing & Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC) in Japan and the United States, a framework for sharing knowledge related to information security, and is actively utilizing it to learn promptly about cases that occur within the industry and put them to use in our company’s development phase.
Toyota also refers to the best practices in the industry (specifically, best practices found in Auto-ISAC) to protect our vehicles against cybersecurity risks. These include the concept of security by design,*1 layered defense,*2 and security tests. We are advancing additional measures to further solidify our vehicle cybersecurity in cooperation with external professional organizations. We are also promoting responses to the international standards concerning cybersecurity, which were adopted at the World Forum for the Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP29)*3 in 2020.
For personal information, individual education ensures that employees are well aware of the importance of following the law and handling information appropriately. We checked our compliance status with regard to EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in FY2019 and with regard to the US California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in FY2020.
We will continue working to protect personal information by providing education and checking the handling status on a periodic basis and conducting activities for improvement, in view of the rising public awareness and changes in the environment in recent years.
 
Preparing for Information Leaks and External Attacks

 
Our specialized team gathers information and monitors the situation at Toyota Motor Corporation, its subsidiaries and affiliates regarding information leaks and attacks from outside the company. If a serious incident occurs, a response team is formed including members in management positions, to settle the situation properly and promptly.
In fiscal 2020, no cases of serious leakage of confidential information including personal information occurred. However, the specialized team conducts training periodically, assuming an incident according to the threat trends in general, and reviewed or enhanced the response measures based on the training results, thereby ensuring continuous improvement.
Toyota’s internal security systems, common measures and rules receive third-party evaluations based on industry standards (ISO27001/2, NIST SP800-82/52, IEC62443). For the problems pointed out in the evaluations, we implement necessary measures to raise our security level.
Furthermore, as a measure against increasing cyber attacks, Toyota has taken out a cyber security insurance that covers all our consolidated subsidiaries since 2018, with the aim of reducing the security risk.
 

 

*1 Security by design: Design approach that defines the security requirements needed for safe system operations from the beginning of planning and design phases of an information system, and which aims to reliably incorporate these requirements into the information system through the development processes, moving away from the approach of implementing security countermeasures only after a problem has been discovered.
*2 Layered defense: Security practice of combining multiple defense “layers” to enhance security, so that an attack is not successful even if one layer is penetrated.
*3 WP29: World Forum for the Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations is a forum organized under the United Nations for the purpose of promoting the international harmonization of safety and environmental regulations for vehicles and the international approval of vehicle certifications by the governments.

Compliance


 
Fundamental Approach
The Guiding Principles at Toyota state that Toyota shall “honor the language and spirit of the law of every country and region, and undertake open and fair business activities to be a strong corporate citizen of the world.” Toyota believes that adhering to this principle is to fulfill corporate social responsibility and ensure compliance.
The Toyota Code of Conduct (formulated in 1998 and revised in 2018) outlines the basic frame of mind that all members of Toyota should adopt. It shows concrete guidelines for the Guiding Principles at Toyota to carry out social responsibilities. This booklet is distributed to all our employees.
We also hold Sustainability Meetings to report and discuss the expectations of our stakeholders and our responses to various social issues including compliance.
 
Checks to Enhance Compliance

 
In FY2009, Toyota began implementing internal checks to enhance its compliance structure. In FY2010 these checks were extended to subsidiaries in and outside Japan. Since then, these checks have been carried out and improved every year.
Results are reported to Sustainability Meeting and used as a basis for further improvement. By incorporating improvement points into each year’s action plans, we ensure that these checks lead to continuous improvement.
We also have discussions with subsidiaries to understand their compliance efforts and provide support when needed.
 

 

Ensuring Compliance
To ensure that awareness of compliance extends throughout the company from top management to each employee, Toyota provides compliance training programs to all employees on every suitable occasion, such as at the time of joining the company, promotion, and overseas assignment. Furthermore, the company periodically conducts the Business Compliance Seminar in which personnel in charge from the responsible division gives lectures on various laws and regulations that the employees must understand when carrying out their tasks, as well as e-learning. Lecture type individual trainings are also given to
in-house divisions and subsidiaries in Japan according to their specific needs and requests.

Bribery/Corruption Prevention Measures

 
In response to the global expansion of our business and increasing social demands, Toyota adopted Anti-bribery Guidelines for internal divisions and business partners in 2012 to promote the eradication of bribery/corruption.
In addition to prohibiting the bribery of public officials, the Anti-bribery Guidelines also include stipulations that prohibit bribery/corruption of others who are not public officials and require the preparation and retention of accurate accounting records, as well as the reporting of improprieties when they are found and cooperation when investigations are carried out.
In addition to the above, internal guidelines also stipulate the following.
•	Points to follow when entering business partnerships (detailed audits, execution of contracts)
•	Points to follow related to the payment of various expenses (gifts, donations, remunerations, etc.)
•	Reporting impropriety when found/who to consult
•	Penalties for violations and internal disciplinary measures

The internal guidelines have been written in Japanese and English, while there are Japanese, English, Chinese, Spanish, Thai, and Indonesian language versions of the guidelines for business partners.
Along with posting the internal guidelines on the company intranet and posting the guidelines for business partners on the public company site, we are also promoting higher awareness through various training and education programs and activities to ensure thorough awareness, thus implementing initiatives to strengthen our anti-bribery systems and prevent corruption.
In addition, bribery/corruption prevention has been incorporated into inspection activities since 2013, as we move forward with improvement activities aimed at strengthening anti-bribery systems which also include our subsidiaries.
 

Initiatives for Taxation
Toyota formulated a taxation policy in September 2020, and disseminated it to all of the subsidiaries to promulgate Toyota's stance on tax payment and taxation policy in an easily understandable manner and promote our stakeholder's understanding on it.
Going forward, Toyota will endeavor to practice tax-related duties of high quality by maintaining compliance on taxation.

“Speak up” Hotline
Toyota has established hotlines for quick and appropriate responses to concerns, complaints or questions that employees may have.
Conventionally, several hotlines have been set up separately depending on the types of consultations, including a Compliance Hotline run by an outside law firm (subcontractor), which allows employees to have consultations concerning compliance-related issues, and hotlines for harassments. Starting from April 2020, these hotlines have been integrated into the “Speak up” Hotline. We are making sure that user is aware of the hotline by using intranet and various other media. Consultations are provided through law firms, websites and telephone for our employees and their family members for issues related to their workplaces and duties (The hotline is also available to dispatched employees, in-house contractors and business partners for consultations on matters related to employees or workplaces of Toyota Motor Corporation.)
The content of a consultation is passed to the division responsible either anonymously or openly upon request and the details are investigated carefully to ensure that the employee who voiced the concern is not identified so that he/she will not feel uneasy. If the results of the investigation indicate an issue, a response is implemented immediately. For cases where an issue is actually identified, we confirm the facts and take appropriate measures in accordance with company regulations such as Work Regulations.

Toyota Consolidated Helpline

 
Toyota Motor Corporation has set up the Toyota Consolidated Helpline (run by an outside law firm as a subcontractor) in addition to hotlines set up at each subsidiary. Employees of Toyota’s subsidiaries in Japan and their family members may use this hotline as an option other than the hotline of their own companies when they have compliance-related questions regarding their companies.
