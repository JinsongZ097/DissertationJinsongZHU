Corporate Principles

Toyota strives to be a good corporate citizen trusted by all stakeholders and to contribute to creating an affluent society through all its business operations. The corporate principles are explained as follows, with our basic values and mindset.

Five Main Principles of Toyoda	Relationship with Philosophy, Hoshin and Regular Business Activities

Guiding Principles at Toyota
 

Since its foundation to the present day, Toyota has handed down the Five Main Principles of Toyoda released in October 1935 which embody the thinking of the founder of the Toyota Group, Sakichi Toyoda, and are the basis of corporate management.
In 1992, in response to changes in society and business structure, Toyota established the Guiding Principles (revised in
April 1997) to clarify how Toyota is expected to be, based on the recognition that strong policies are important for finding the way to proceed, especially when the environment surrounding us is drastically changing.

Toyota Global Vision	Toyota Way 2001

 
The Toyota Global Vision—announced in March 2011—reflects lessons learned from financial losses caused by the global economic crisis in 2008 and the series of recall issues of 2010. It reflects company-wide review and comprehensive discussions on how Toyota wants to be, and the kind of values it should esteem.
The Five Main Principles of Toyoda, the Guiding Principles at Toyota, and the Toyota Way 2001 are fundamental values of Toyota's corporate activities.
To be sustainable in society, we strive to implement a positive cycle of making ever-better cars that exceed customer expectations; contributing to Enriching lives of Communities by being rewarded with the smile of customers and communities; and achieving a stable business base.
 
The Toyota Way 2001, defined in April 2001, clarifies the values and business methods that all employees should embrace in order to carry out the Guiding Principles at Toyota.
The Toyota Way is supported by two main pillars: “Continuous Improvement” and “Respect for People.” Continuous Improvement means that we are never satisfied with where we are and always work to improve our business by putting forward new ideas and working to the best of our abilities.
Respect for People means that we respect all Toyota stakeholders and believe the success of our business is created by individual effort.

We form a long-term vision, meeting challenges with courage and creativity to realize our dreams
 



We improve our business operations continuously, always driving for innovation and evolution

Toyota Production System (TPS)

Toyota’s vehicle production system is a way of “making things” that is sometimes referred to as a “lean manufacturing system” or a “Just-in-Time (JIT) system,” and has come to be well known and studied worldwide. This production control system has been established based on many years of continuous improvements, with the objective of “making the vehicles ordered by customers in the quickest and most efficient way, in order to deliver the vehicles as quickly as possible.”
The Toyota Production System (TPS) was established based on two concepts: The first is called jidoka (which can be loosely translated as “automation with a human touch”) which means that when a problem occurs, the equipment stops immediately, preventing defective products from being produced; The second is the concept of “Just-in-Time,” in which each process produces only what is needed by the next process in a continuous flow.
Based on the basic philosophies of jidoka and Just-in-Time, the TPS can efficiently and quickly produce vehicles of sound quality, one at a time, that fully satisfy customer requirements.

Structure
As the automotive industry faces once-in-a-century dramatic changes, it is a requirement to make ever quicker decisions and be ever more efficient with work. Meanwhile, stakeholder
levels of expectation regarding non-financial issues, centered on the environment (E), society (S), and governance (G), are also increasing.
To respond to these changes, Toyota established its Sustainability Meeting in 2018. Chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, members include external directors and external auditors. The Meeting discusses non-financial issues from a range of angles, and confirms management directions.
We have also set up the ESG Committee within the Sustainability Meeting, in which the executive officers in charge lead discussions toward solving individual issues promptly.
 
Sustainability Issues

In line with the Five Main Principles of Toyoda and the Guiding Principles at Toyota, we aim to grow with the community as we have since our founding, however these days the automobile industry and the social environment are both changing greatly. To grow sustainably within this changing world, Toyota identifies sustainability issues based on the importance for our business and the expectations of our stakeholders in order to be a trusted company.
In defining sustainability issues, we are studying the business environment Toyota is acting according to internationally-agreed standards, such as the Paris Agreement1, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights2, and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs3), as well as expert advice. Thus we define issues to improve corporate value or strengthening management foundation and risk management.
Toyota checks progress on these issues periodically by discussing them in the Sustainability Meeting and the ESG Committee.

Initiatives Aligned with Global Society
Toyota is working on initiatives that contribute to sustainable development of society and the earth through all its business activities in cooperation with global society. At the root of this are the Five Main Principles of Toyoda, passed down as the basis of our corporate management, and the Guiding Principles, which lay out how we are expected to be as a company. In 2011, we announced the Toyota Global Vision, which lays out how we want to be as a company, based on our experiences with the 2008 global financial crisis and the series of recalls we had in 2010.
These ideas and values of Toyota are in line with the aims of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which went into effect in January 2016. In the 17 goals, Toyota will contribute to solving global social issues by using its strengths by working to reduce traffic casualties (goal 3), building sustainable cities and communities and improving mobility (goal 11), and taking actions to address climate change (goal 13).
In addition, environmental issues are one of the key aspects of what Toyota sees as sustainability issues. With a view to the “under 2˚C” scenario1 agreed on in the Paris Agreement, we are promoting initiatives under the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050. In 2018, we established our midterm goals and are tackling the challenges that make positive change for the environment.
In addition, Toyota is a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD2) In the Transforming Mobility project, which started in 2018, we intend to clarify issues with specialists, in order to incorporate the major environmental changes happening around cars such as sharing and autonomous driving into future mobility systems.
1	At the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Paris in 2015, efforts to reduce net emissions of CO2, etc., to zero in the second half of this century were agreed upon with a long-term goal of keeping the rise in the global average temperature to well below 2˚C compared to the pre- industrial revolution level.
2	The World Business Council for Sustainable Development, headquartered in Geneva, conducts surveys and makes suggestions on economic growth, environmental preservation, and social development from a global perspective toward sustainable development. Around 200 companies from various industries around the world have joined the council. Since its inception in linkage with the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, the WBCSD has proposed the environmental
management system “ISO 14000” and Eco-efficiency, a management philosophy that encourages business to search for environmental improvements that yield parallel economic benefits. The WBCSD also supports SDG-related initiatives.

Initiatives for Improving Traffic Safety

Fundamental Approach According to a World Health Organization (WHO) survey*, 1.25 million people worldwide died in traffic accidents, making them the ninth leading cause of death. While the number of
deaths due to traffic accidents has been decreasing slightly in Japan, the United States and Europe, it has been constantly increasing in emerging nations and regions where traffic safety education and transportation infrastructure have not kept up with increases in the number of cars on the road. Unless countermeasures are implemented, traffic fatalities are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030. In order to achieve Toyota’s ultimate goal of Zero Casualties from Traffic Accidents, the development of safe vehicles is of course important, but it is also essential to educate people, namely drivers and pedestrians and to ensure safe traffic infrastructure including traffic signals and roads. Toward achieving a safe mobility society, Toyota believes it is important to promote an Integrated Three Part Initiative, involving people, vehicles, and the traffic environment, as well as to pursue Real-world Safety by learning from actual accidents and incorporating that knowledge into vehicle development. Toyota has also defined its Integrated Safety Management Concept as the basic philosophy behind technologies toward achieving the elimination of traffic casualties and is moving forward with developing such technologies.

Integrated Safety Management Concept
Toyota provides optimum driver support for each stage of driving, from parking to normal operation, the accident
itself, the pre-and post-crash timeframe, and post-accident rescue. Toyota’s approach is to enhance safety levels through strengthening intersystem coordination rather than seeing each one separately. This is what’s behind our Integrated Safety Management Concept.

Actual Status of Traffic Accidents and Toyota’s Safety Technology
There were 3,694 traffic fatalities in Japan in 2017, a drop of 210 people over the previous year. This
 
Number of Traffic Fatalities by Accident Type	Number of Traffic Fatalities of the Elderly (65 Years
or Older)
 
was the lowest number since the National Police Agency began keeping records in 1948. Going by road users, pedestrians accounted for the largest number of deaths, with the percentage of fatalities among the elderly (65 year or older) increasing yearly. Another emerging issue is accidents caused by drivers pressing the accelerator by mistake instead of the brake in parking lots, or driving the wrong way down expressways, which are both more common among the elderly. This is becoming a major social issue. This is why more and more attention is being given to active safety technologies that help prevent accidents in addition to the existing passive safety features.
At Toyota, we are working on installing the Toyota Safety Sense system that packages multiple active

safety systems, including automatic braking, on almost all our passenger vehicle models. We are also working on developing ICS, which helps prevent accidents caused by pressing the wrong pedal.
Automated driving technology, which is an aggregation of advanced driving support technologies, is expected to make a big difference in helping reduce the number of casualties from traffic accidents. Toyota is placing the highest priority on safety and actively working on developing automated driving technologies, with the aim of achieving a world in which every person can enjoy mobility safely, easily, and freely.

Active Safety

Toyota is developing Active Safety Systems that can keep cars and people free from accidents.

The Number of Vehicles with Toyota Safety Sense Has Topped 8 Million Globally
In 2015, Toyota introduced its new active safety package, Toyota Safety Sense, as a way to roll out safety systems that would contribute to greatly reducing deaths and injuries. Toyota Safety Sense is based on the idea of supporting the driver by assuming safe driving by the driver, reducing the number of accidents as well as helping mitigate damage in the event of an accident. We can work to help avoid collisions or mitigate damage from low to high speeds by packing multiple active safety functions. Our package is based around Pre-collision Safety (PCS), which works to either help avoid collisions with cars ahead or pedestrians, Lane Departure Alert (LDA), which contributes to preventing accidents caused by leaving the lane, Automatic High Beam (AHB), which helps ensure clear sight in front at night. With regard to the actual safety of cars with Toyota Safety Sense installed in real traffic environments, there was a reduction of about 50 percent in rear-end collisions and about 90 percent in combination with the ICS, which helps avoid collisions at low speeds, such as sudden acceleration or hitting other cars and collisions in parking lots (Toyota comparison). In November 2017, we completed Toyota Safety Sense (either as standard or as an option) for almost all passenger vehicles in Japan, North America, and Europe. The number of vehicles with Toyota Safety Sense now tops more than 8 million globally (as of April 2018). In other regions, we are progressively rolling it out to the market as we confirm the various regulations and traffic conditions in each area.
 
Second Generation Toyota Safety Sense Which Is the Active Safety Package Rolled Out from 2018 Toyota Safety Sense, now enhanced to its second generation, is being progressively introduced started from new 2018 models, mainly in Japan, North America, and Europe. The second generation uses two sensors to detect shapes and distance, the single-lens camera and the millimeter-wave radar, to prevent accidents and reduce the number of deaths and injuries from traffic accidents, and ease driver burden. The evolution of the second generation has been in the following three areas: (1) improving functionality through improvements to the performance of the camera and radar to expand the scope of hazard detection, (2) utilization of the advanced driving support feature Lane Tracing Assist (LTA), and (3) reduction of the size of the unit to improve ease of installation. For example, as we are expanding our coverage of serious accidents by adding nighttime pedestrians and cyclists to the scope of hazards detected by PCS, we can reduce the number of collisions between pedestrians and cars at night, which currently account for approx. 70 percent of all fatal pedestrian accidents and bicycle-car collisions, which account for approx. 75 percent of all fatal cyclist accidents. In addition, we package advanced driver support functions to reduce driver burden and improve convenience.

ITS Connect, Cooperative Driving Support System
Launched in the autumn of 2015, ITS Connect features a cooperative driving support system which utilizes vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The system acquires and alerts the driver of the information about the presence of cars and pedestrians that are in blind spots outside the field of vision of onboard sensors, and about traffic signals to help reduce accidents at accident- prone intersections.
In the future, by linking ITS technologies with control technologies, Toyota is aiming to realize automated driving that will enable every driver to enjoy mobility safely, easily, and freely.

Passive Safety

Passive safety combines a body structure that absorbs collision energy with devices that efficiently protect the vehicle occupants in order to minimize collision damage.
In 1995, Toyota set up unique, stringent internal goals related to passive safety performance called “Global Outstanding Assessment (GOA),” in order to pursue world-leading safety levels, and developed a collision-safety body and passenger protection devices. Since then, to maintain leadership in this field, Toyota has continued to advance GOA, improving the real safety performance of its vehicles in a wide variety of accidents.
Furthermore, to analyze the human body injury mechanism, Toyota developed Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS), a virtual human body model that simulates effects on human bodies that cannot be measured using dummies. THUMS has been utilized in predicting injuries to the various parts of the human body.
 
Impact-absorbing Body and High-strength Cabin
To reduce injury to vehicle occupants during a collision, it is crucial to prevent vehicle doors and other objects outside the vehicle from penetrating the cabin and to absorb the collision impact. The latest collision-safety structure consisting of an impact-absorbing body and a high-strength cabin incorporates the concept of “compatibility,” aiming to ensure the mutual safety of vehicles of different weights and heights if they collide.
Furthermore, in car manufacturing based on the “Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA)” next- generation platform strategy, Toyota developed a vehicle body that demonstrates exceptional collision safety in frontal, side, rear, and even oblique frontal collision tests, based on the latest GOA. The newly developed body was adopted in the Prius launched in 2015, the C-HR launched in 2016, the Prius PHV, Camry, Lexus LC and LS launched in 2017, and the Crown and Corolla Sports launched in 2018.

Setting Preventive Link Functions
Based on Toyota’s Integrated Safety Management Concept of increasing safety by linking individual systems, we are working on technology development for preventive link functions that operate protective devices in a collision by linking with the Pre-collision Safety (PCS) system.
We have developed functions that prepare to deploy the seatbelt mechanism or SRS* side & curtain shield airbags to protect the occupants when the PCS determines that a collision with another vehicle is likely, or prepare to deploy the pop-up hood to protect the pedestrian or cyclist when the PCS determines that a collision with a pedestrian or cyclist is likely.
The Lexus LS, which was launched in October 2017, has a function to prepare the side & curtain shield airbags and the pop-up hood, while the new Crown, which was launched in June 2018, has a function to prepare the seatbelt system and pop-up hood.

THUMS Virtual Human Body Model
THUMS, the virtual human body model that allows computer simulation of the damage bodies receive when subjected to impacts, recreates the dynamic characteristics of the human body, including its shape, the strength of bones, and the flexibility of organs and skin.
We can forecast the extent of injuries sustained throughout the human body through THUMS, and since its development in 2000, it has been utilized in the technological development of passenger protection devices such as airbags, and to contribute to improved vehicle safety performance.
Since 2007, Toyota has been applying THUMS to injury analysis of accidents involving general vehicles as well as motor sports. In March 2017, Toyota signed a four-year joint THUMS-based research agreement with the Global Institute for Motor Sport Safety which presides over research on safety in motor sports.
 
Emergency Response

Every minute counts in emergency response for accidents or sudden illness. In 2000, Toyota rolled out HELPNET® service, an emergency reporting system utilizing the G-Book information network (the
current T-Connect) and G-Link. As of June 2018, HELPNET® has more than 1.7 million members. Under HELPNET®, a dedicated operator will promptly contact the police or rescue services to arrange emergency vehicles in the event of a sudden accident or illness. It automatically contacts an operator when the airbag deploys and supports the D-Call Net® which makes quick deployment decisions for air ambulances, etc.

Emergency Reporting System (D-Call Net®)
The D-Call Net® is one of the automated rescue alert systems that use connective technology in vehicles to further increase the ratio of lives saved in a traffic accident. When an airbag goes off in a traffic accident, vehicle data regarding the impact direction, severity of collision and whether seatbelts were fastened is automatically sent, where it is analyzed based on data from 2.8 million other accidents in Japan to estimate the likelihood of death or serious injury. This information is sent to the fire department headquarters and the EMS helicopter base hospital, allowing prompt decisions to be made sending
an air ambulance or a ground ambulance, saving time before they can be dispatched and helping save more lives. Since November 2015, Toyota has been working with the Emergency Medical Network
of Helicopter and Hospital (HEM-Net), Honda Motor Co., Ltd., and Japan Mayday Service Co., Ltd. (HELPNET®) to implement trial operation of D-Call Net®, and started full-scale operation in June 2018.

Parking Assist	Automated Driving

 
About 30 percent of all traffic accidents are said to occur in parking lots*. Checking around the car for safety and repeated steering maneuvers tend to burden drivers, which, along with pedal misapplication, can lead to serious accidents. Toyota has developed technology to improve visibility and to assist driving maneuvers during parking operations in order to prevent accidents and minimize damage.
* Source: “Statistics of Parking Lot Accidents” (statistics from six prefectures in Tohoku Region) from the General Insurance Association of Japan


Parking Support Brakes Help Reduce Accidents in Parking Lots
Parking lots are busy with many people and cars, requiring careful awareness of surroundings and complicated driving techniques, which means they are also places where accidents are common. Toyota has developed the Parking Support Brakes (PKSB) system to further improve safety when parking, and equipped them on the Lexus LS, launched in October 2017.
In addition to the existing ICS, which reduces damage or avoids collisions with objects in the direction of movement front or rear and Rear Cross Traffic Auto Brakes, which prevent collisions with vehicles nearing the rear when backing out of parking areas, the PKSB system uses rear cameras to detect pedestrians behind the vehicle when reversing out, and if there is the risk of a collision, it sounds an alarm and operates the brakes automatically—a world first—thus avoiding or reducing damage from a collision.
We are carrying out technology development from a range of angles to assist driving when parking as well. We have already brought to market Clearance Sonar, which alerts drivers to obstacles, Drive-Start Control, which limits sudden starts or sudden acceleration during gear-shift operations, Intelligent Parking Assist, which assists with steering when parking, Panoramic View Monitor, which shows images looking down from above the car to allow drivers to check the safety of their surroundings, Back Guide Monitor, which helps with smooth reversing parking using guidelines. These allow us to contribute to reducing driving burden in parking lots.
Parking Support Brake (Objects, Vehicles in the Rear, Pedestrians
 
To help achieve Zero Casualties from Traffic Accidents, Toyota has been conducting research and development on automated driving technologies since the 1990s. Toyota’s unique approach to automated driving, called the “Mobility Teammate Concept,” seeks out a relationship between people and vehicles so they stand by and support one another as companions would do. Based on this philosophy, Toyota is aiming to help realize a world in which every person, including the elderly and the physically challenged, can enjoy mobility safely, easily, and freely.

   

Support for Initiatives at Collaborative Safety Research Center (CSRC), the U.S.
In January 2011, with the goal of establishing safer and more reliable transportation means, Toyota established the CSRC inside the Toyota Technical Center (TTC) located in the state of Michigan. The first- phase project was completed at the CSRC in March 2017. Over a five-year period, the CSRC started and completed 44 research projects jointly with 23 universities and research organizations, publishing more than 200 technical papers. Furthermore, the CSRC has been making its research results public through presentations at various vehicle safety-related conferences so that these results can be utilized by people engaged in the development of vehicle and traffic safety technologies.
In 2017, Toyota started a new second-phase project called “CSRC Next.” This reflects Toyota’s position that it is important to understand how humans will cope with advancing vehicle technologies. Toyota will invest 35 million dollars over five years, focusing on the issues related to and possibilities of autonomous

Initiatives Targeting People

Believing that educating people is also important for preventing traffic accidents, Toyota started donating traffic safety teaching materials for small children by donating traffic safety picture books and story-telling card sets to children starting kindergarten and nursery school nationwide in the 1960s, in cooperation with Toyota dealers nationwide. Since then, Toyota has been holding the Toyota Safety School designed for small children every year. In 2005, we established the Toyota Safety Education Center Mobilitas at the Fuji Speedway. We also hold Toyota Driver Communication, a safe driving technique seminar aimed at drivers. Overseas, Toyota affiliates are taking initiatives on education and edification, taking into account each country or region’s traffic and accident situations, as well as people’s awareness about traffic safety.
Additionally, capitalizing on its many years of traffic safety programs, Toyota is supporting efforts by local affiliates, for example helping train safe driving instructors in Thailand and Vietnam.

The Support Toyota Program Is Supporting Safety and Assurance through Technology and People
With the spread of the Safety Support Car (“Sapo Car”) program recommended by the government, we are working with Toyota dealers to continue to spread our safety technologies further and keep our customers informed. This is why we are rolling out Support Toyota (the overall name for our safety and assurance activities) to help achieve car lifestyles that offer safety and assurance.
 
Starting with traffic safety education activities like our Machihotaru (City Firefly) Project, which recommends effective use of high beam headlights to drivers and wearing accessories made of reflective materials to pedestrians, we carry out ongoing license seminars on safety technology (ICS) for dealer staff as a way to increase experiences of safety technology at customer-oriented dealerships. In addition, at our Support Toyota Park event, which is held by dealerships to raise awareness of traffic safety, we work with local governments and others to get local residents to participate in a range of Support Toyota hands-on experience events that make use of facilities and courses such as a driving schools, promoting initiatives for the achievement of a zero traffic fatalities or injuries society.


 	 
 


 
For 50 Years, We Have Donated Traffic Safety Picture Books and Story Cards from One Concept That an Unchanging Belief Can Change the World
Our traffic safety education activities started back in 1969, which means 2018 is their 50th anniversary. There is a large spike in pedestrian deaths among seven-year-olds. This is why Toyota has been providing traffic safety picture books and story cards on the theme of “the dangers of running out into the road” to preschoolers. So far, we have given away about 144.07 million picture books and 1.66 million story cards. Our traffic safety programs will continue as we broaden its scope even further.
As the times change, so do cars. But our hopes that our loved ones stay safe remains unchanging. Toyota’s activities and programs will continue with this one unchanging wish. We believe that even small efforts, if done often enough, can grow into an engine of change for the world. “Safety is Toyota’s wish.

Customer First and Quality First Measures

Fundamental Approach The origins of Toyota’s “Customer First” and “Quality First” principles lie in the Five Main Principles of Toyoda, which embody the thinking of Sakichi Toyoda, and the spirit of audit and
improvement of Kiichiro Toyoda. Since its foundation, Toyota has established a corporate culture that focuses particular attention on quality that will produce customer smiles and on kaizen (continuous improvement) achieved through genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience). In accordance with our commitment to quality as stated in the Toyota Global Vision, each employee in every area maintains a constant and strong awareness of issues and a sense of ownership and makes ongoing efforts to implement kaizen and to collaborate closely with personnel in other fields to enhance customer safety, peace of mind, and satisfaction.

Toyota’s Concept to Quality	Quality Assurance Cycle
 

Toyota sees quality as the combination of product quality, sales and service quality, and the quality of work performed by each employee that serves as the foundation supporting the other aspects of quality.
We also believe that products and services that gain the confidence of customers can be created only when each employee, who engages in every process from development, purchasing, production, and sales to after-sales service activities,
builds in quality and implements the quality assurance cycle.
The origins of quality lie in the spirit of audit and improvement, and Toyota’s unchanging monozukuri (manufacturing) pursues ever higher quality through continuous improvement based on repeated implementation of PDCA* cycle.

Organization and Structure
Toyota establishes a Quality Function Policy each year based on the policy for 2018. In 2018, we have identified focal activities and are working on various issues based on the policy of “Establish a solid foundation by adhering rigidly to the work basics and build competitive quality from the customer’s viewpoint.”
The fundamentals of action are function management and policy management.
Function management refers to setting company-wide policies based on a function that ensures quality and each group and company taking action in collaboration with other divisions.
Policy management refers to the formulation and implementation of action plans for achieving targets in each group and company, based on the company-wide policy. During the implementation phase, progress and results are reported through Quality Function Board and other forums and responses are carried out as needed.
In addition, in order to strengthen quality improvement activities led by the regions, Toyota has appointed Chief Quality Officers (CQOs) in Japan and other regions around the world to address regional issues and promote global collaboration.
In 2012 the Customer First Promotion Group (CF Promotion Group) was established to strengthen in- house systems for quality improvement in order to be a Quality Leader from customer’s perspective.

Global Implementation Structure of Policy and the Quality Conference
 
Strengthen Quality Improvement Measures through Region-driven Measures Centered on CQOs In 2010, we established the Chief Quality Officer (CQO) system to strengthen collaboration with each region for the purpose of gathering and globally sharing information on the real voice of regional customers and measures being taken. We are taking actions to improve quality on a global scale. For example, among the meetings of the Quality Function Board, the highest-order global conferences held by TMC several times each year, the one in January requires CQOs from all regions to attend. Also, appropriate CQOs are invited to other meetings, depending on their agendas.
Additionally, each region has organized a variety of quality-related conferences. For the highest-order conference chaired by the regional CQO, TMC sends its Global CQO or a secretariat member in order to facilitate and support better communication and collaboration.

Quality Month Activities for Raising Employee Awareness regarding Quality
Toyota designates every November as Quality Month and sets a theme each year with the aim of encouraging each employee to consider the importance of the Customer First and Quality First policies and raising work quality so that we can be rewarded with the smiles of customers. Activities are conducted to promote the sense of ownership in quality by employees in a manner that will lead to action. The theme in FY2018 was “Let’s
listen to customer’s voice with sincerity and take action obediently and rapidly!” to return to Toyota’s founding principles and be rewarded with the smiles of customers. Company-wide measures were taken to learn about the current status of quality challenges Toyota is facing and for each employee to ensure higher quality of work. There were two issues behind this theme.
The first was “listening more carefully to customer voice and quickly incorporating it into products to improve them,” which was made clear by the evaluation information from customers and society.
The second was “completely eliminating simple mistakes such as wrong assumptions and copying mistakes,” which was made clear from thorough root cause analysis of the recent measures taken in the market.
Recognition about these issues was shared throughout the entire company, and each employee analyzed and reassessed his/her day-to-day work through discussions on quality held at
each workplace. These steps have helped improve work quality and provided us with an opportunity to return to the starting point of “Customer First,” “Quality First,” and “Genchi Genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience),” which express the true character of Toyota.
We have also taken other actions, such as holding exhibits of quality examples targeting both Toyota internal employees and suppliers, the All-Toyota TQM Convention, and lectures for facilitating understanding about the usage environment of cars in each region. The goal was to enhance the quality
 
awareness level in each workplace.

Coping with Quality Troubles
We have a system whereby each employee takes action to enhance quality in accordance with the Customer First Principle and prepares for and responds in a timely manner to quality-related issues. When making recall decisions, quality failures are determined not simply based on legal compliance, but also from the customer’s perspective, putting safety and assurance first.
Final decisions are made with the participation of regional representatives, who are closest to customers, so that feedback from regional customers can be
accurately reflected.
After the decision to recall is made, Toyota contacts individual customers through dealers, and additionally posts information on its website to ensure prompt repair service.
We will continue to improve our products so our customers can drive Toyota cars safely and with peace of mind.
 
own work sites. As the number of employees who experienced the recall issues firsthand dwindles, human resources who can hand down this information at each worksite are essential for permanently maintaining the experiences and lessons of the recalls. Starting in 2017, this activity was expanded companywide, with the storytellers speaking at their work sites about their experiences and the lessons they learned. They are also working to train the next generation of storytellers in order to prevent any fading of the lessons learned from the recall issues.

Storytelling Activities to Maintain Focus on the Series of Recall Issues
February 24, the day that President Akio Toyoda attended U.S. Congressional hearings held to investigate the series of recall issues that occurred in 2010, was designated “Toyota Restart Day.” We are creating mechanisms and taking measures to raise awareness in order to maintain focus on the lessons learned from the experiences Toyota underwent at that time.
For example, in 2014 Toyota established its Customer Quality Learning Centers as education facilities for conveying the experiences and lessons Toyota learned from the series of recall issues to future
generations of employees. Exhibits that appeal to the five senses, such as actual examples of faulty parts and vehicle simulators, help Toyota employees learn the importance of quality. The Customer Quality Learning Centers are open to voluntary visits by Toyota employees and can also be utilized as facilities for rank-specific education. The Centers offer important programs to educate new employees who
are unfamiliar with the situation at the time of the series of recall issues. Every year, on Toyota Restart Day, current quality issues are added to renew the program. We are making these efforts to create key education facilities for maintaining focus on all that Toyota learned. Globally, Toyota has opened approximately 30 Customer Quality Learning Centers (as of the end of March 2018).
We are also working to ensure employees in each region and each plant thoroughly understand the importance of quality. In storytelling activities, employees who experienced those recall issues take on the role of storyteller to convey the facts and lessons learned from the series of recall issues within their

Customer First Measures

Toyota’s principle of Customer First exists for the purpose of providing customers with products and services that earn their smiles. Toyota hopes to offer cars with superior features in terms of environmental, safety and quality performance, while also offering the intrinsic appeal of cars, such as high driving performance, at an affordable price.
We humbly and obediently accept information provided by our dealers and customer feedback received at customer assistance centers, taking them to heart and utilizing them for making ever-better cars.

System for Implementing Customer Feedback (Japan)
In order to respond to customer inquiries, opinions, and requests, the most recent customer feedback is gathered from dealers. Also, we established the customer assistance centers and are taking actions which lead to the creation of ever-better cars and services.
 
Toyota Customer Assistance Center and Lexus Information Desk The Toyota Customer Assistance Center and the Lexus Information Desk are open for consultation 365 days a year,
and have established a structure designed to ensure constant customer satisfaction.
Toyota offers speedy, appropriate and empathetic responses to customer inquiries, and listens to opinions and requests, based on the principle of Customer First. At the same time, Toyota addresses all issues while also maintaining close cooperation with its dealers. Furthermore, the Salesperson Support Desk has been established in order to support dealers in implementing the Customer First principle.
Toyota also conducts surveys of customers who use our telephone service via an automated response system, in an effort to continuously make further improvements.

Ongoing Customer First Staff Education
To coincide with the designation of every May as Consumer’s Month by the Japanese government, Toyota has declared it Customer’s Month, and undertakes initiatives aimed at spreading awareness of the Customer First principle throughout the company. The Customer Feedback Exhibitions present feedback from customers not just in Japan but around the world, as well as initiatives taken from the customer’s perspective. The exhibitions serve as forums for each employee to reconfirm the importance of listening to customer feedback.
The exhibition in May 2018 was held under the theme “Does Toyota’s (your) common sense deviate from customers?” and presented customer feedback categorized into product/usage disparities and response/action disparities. The exhibition provided us with an opportunity to contemplate the
“disparities between customers’ expectations, requests, and actual situations” and “the actions that we at Toyota consider appropriate.” It also exhibited customer voices of appreciation, helping our employees gain awareness and motivation. A lecture was also held on customer-first measures taken by companies in other industries.
As part of employee education, “Experience and Learn from Customer Feedback” sessions are held to observe and experience the functioning of our call center, the Customer Assistance Center. A Customer Feedback Board summarizing customer feedback has been posted on the company intranet, drawing employee attention to issues of concern to customers.
Furthermore, we are actively encouraging some of our employees to obtain the Consumer Affairs Advisor qualification, which is certified by the Japanese Prime Minister. Facility and vehicle evaluation from the customer’s viewpoint is also held by a group of experts, the Toyota Consumer Affairs Advisor Group.

After-sales Services Measures

To bring smiles to the faces of as many customers as possible, it is essential to simultaneously achieve both better cars and better services. Customer car use requires regular check-ups, legally mandated inspections, and repairs following breakdowns or accidents. After-sales service provides safety, peace of mind, and comfort to customers at these times, and continues support for the Toyota and Lexus brands. In recent years, the average duration of car use has been lengthening (in FY2018, the average vehicle age excluding minivehicles in Japan was 12.9 years), increasing by 1.3 years from 10 years ago. As a result, the role of after-sales service is becoming increasingly important. More than 100 million Toyota vehicles are currently owned worldwide and each of them is irreplaceable to the customer. Toyota is taking measures to provide ever-better services in accordance with the concept of the 3S Spirit (Seikaku
+ Shinsetsu = Shinrai: Accuracy + Caring = Trust) so that we can achieve high levels of customer satisfaction in using their Toyota vehicles.

Organization and Structure
Better service means the ability to safely, accurately, promptly, and inexpensively perform maintenance and repairs in cases of breakdown. To do this, we are working to enhance the serviceability of vehicles that can be repaired quickly and the availability of service parts and to develop service engineers.
Based on the idea that after-sales services begin at the stage of vehicle development, we believe that serviceability is also one aspect of a car’s performance, and serviceability improvement based on market feedback is incorporated into vehicle development. Toyota has also established a system to deliver parts exactly when they are needed to countries around the world so that repairs and other services can be completed in a timely manner. Parts inventories and inspection work are being made more efficient by applying Toyota Production System concepts at dealer worksites.

In terms of tools for supporting service operations, the number of diagnostic codes for identifying failure causes has been increased. When the on-board computer performs self-diagnosis and detects a failure, it sends the diagnostic code for the failed part to the dealer so that the part causing the problem in
the vehicle can be quickly identified. We are also taking innovative steps to improve service operation efficiency by reducing the number of frequently performed operations or automating them.
Service, technology, sales, and other divisions are collaborating on repair techniques to deploy easy- to-repair car manufacturing. They also provide manuals that quickly give the necessary information and make repair work quick and easy.
There are currently approximately 180,000 Toyota personnel involved in after-sales service in Japan and overseas, and educational systems and facilities are being established in each region. The Tajimi Service Center in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, plays a central role in enhancing the knowledge and technical skills of service staff worldwide.
 
Training Centers Develop Global Service Technical Staff
The Tajimi Service Center in Gifu Prefecture, Japan provides training on service technologies and sheet metal painting to service engineers from dealers in Japan and overseas distributors worldwide.
The Tajimi Service Center, which opened in July 2013, includes classrooms, practice fields, and drive evaluation courses with a variety of road conditions on a vast 187,000 m2 site. In FY2018, a total of approximately 2,200 staff members from 26 sites in Japan and overseas were trained at the center, bringing the cumulative total number of attendees to approximately 9,800.

Partner Robots

Toyota is responding to social needs by developing human- assisting partner robots that co-exist with people and support their lives.
Toyota is working towards the practical use of partner robots pursuant to a vision based on a concept of “MOBILITY FOR ALL (with the joy of self-reliance)” with four fields of support: senior life, medical (healthcare), personal life (independence), and welfare (nursing care). By providing robots that support the self-reliance of elderly or disabled persons as well as by reducing the burdens on their caregivers, we can respond to the needs of future society
with a low birth rate and an aging population. Toyota is contributing to the development of a sustainable society and the realization of comfortable lifestyles for all people.

Welwalk WW-1000 Rehabilitation Assist Robot
The Welwalk WW-1000 is designed to support rehabilitation such as walking training for people with lower limb paralysis due to strokes, etc. It features a range of rehabilitation support functions based on exercise learning theory, including an assistance adjustment function to set the level according to the patient, and to provide feedback regarding the patient’s gait characteristics. The robot’s simple construction and functions, such as easy fitting and central touch panel operation, ensure easy use in clinical settings.
Development of rehabilitation robots in the medical support field began at the end of 2007 with the collaboration of Fujita Health University in Toyoake City, Aichi Prefecture. Verification testing has been conducted at medical facilities since 2011. Between 2014 and the end of March 2018, Walk Training Assist robots have been installed in 23 medical facilities throughout Japan for clinical research. In 2016,
 
Development of Winglet Personal Mobility Robot
Toyota is developing Winglet, a personal mobility robot that supports human mobility and makes daily activities more convenient. It is
a form of mobility that makes it possible to travel seamlessly from inside commercial facilities and other indoor locations to outdoors. Through verification tests designed to assess the robot’s safety and convenience, and to encourage its commercialization, we have expanded opportunities for people to experience Winglet.

it obtained approval as a medical device, and from May 2017, we began a rental business aimed at medical institutions, with the goal of having 100 in place. We worked with companies that have strong sales and services in the medical field, and by September 2017 we had supplied products to hospitals and other places. In addition, our website provides the latest information regarding the Welwalk
WW-1000 to medical professionals.
 
We are involved in the development of social robots to support self-sufficient lifestyles for the elderly and helping support caregivers.
To respond to the increase in dementia patients, Pocobee is a robot to prevent and curtail the progression of dementia and contribute to reducing the burdens on caregivers. Verification tests began in 2016 at the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology.
To prevent illnesses such as dementia, it is important to maintain health. To that end, we are enhancing functions that provide target- oriented encouragement to increase what can be done according to person's ability not just increasing what is done normally. As a result, we hope to be able to link this to improved roles (social participation) in society or at home.
By linking caregivers and robots, we hope to safely increase the activities of the elderly and improve their lifestyle functions, as well as contribute to

Expanding the Development Community through Supplying HSRs (Human Support Robots) The Human Support Robot (HSR) is intended to provide a wide range of support including assistance, self-sufficiency, and household tasks. In addition to fundamental tasks such as picking up, carrying, and handing over objects, we are conducting development towards application in preventive health care and health management and are conducting repeated verification trials in senior facilities and households with disabled persons.
On the other hand, work items expected of HSRs from these verifications are very diverse in both quality and quantity. Therefore, starting in 2015, we have supplied HSRs to universities and research institutes as platforms, forming a development community that promotes sharing results and mutual use. In
2016, a joint university team won the technical innovation award at the RoboCup@Home international competition. From the 2017 RoboCup in Nagoya,
we have been supplying HSRs as the standard platform for this competition. It is decided to provide HSRs for the platform in the household task support event at the 2020 World Robot Summit. In this way, we are working to accelerate development through open innovation.

Announcement of the Third-generation Humanoid Robot, T-HR3, Combining Cleverness with Gentleness
In November 2017, Toyota developed and announced the T-HR3 Humanoid Robot, a robot whose entire body can move smoothly through links with the movements of a remote operator.
The T-HR3 is a bipedal “partner robot” suited for living environments. The operator can operate the robot instinctively, with fine movements of the hands and arms. This allows it to walk like a human, while still retaining its balance. The first and second generation humanoid robots, announced in the past, were able to play musical instruments, but needed
precise program-based position control for their finger movements. In contrast, the T-HR3 allows for flexible control of the joints. Our aim is for
it to safely work alongside humans in a range of scenarios, including the home and medical
institutions, acting as a partner robot that gently
 
supports lifestyles. And, in the future, we will move

Support to Agricultural and Food Production Industries
Toyota used the production control methods and process of kaizen (continuous improvement) established in the automotive business to develop Housaku Keikaku, an agricultural IT management tool, in order
to raise productivity in agriculture. Housaku Keikaku has been provided to rice-growing agricultural corporations since 2014. Since April 2014, Toyota has participated in the Advanced Model Agricultural Business Formation Trials conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and has established the Rice Production Kaizen Network in collaboration with Ishikawa Prefecture, as well as nine rice-growing agricultural corporations in Aichi and Ishikawa Prefectures. With the collaboration of Housaku Keikaku and onsite kaizen, we have conducted verification tests to raise efficiency and quality even further and built foundations for development of human resources.
Toyota announced collaboration with Hokkaido and Nagano Prefectures in 2017. The number of agricultural corporations implementing Housaku Keikaku based on collaboration with local governments was 65, as of May 2018. Since April 2018, through business collaboration with two agricultural corporations in Aichi Prefecture, we have been working on developing a large-scale, diversified, cutting- edge agricultural model having the following three characteristics: Smart farming that links big data with advanced technologies; improved distribution and sales processes; and application to multiple kinds of
 
On October 30, 2017, Toyota signed a licensing agreement with Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Eurofins Genomics, and GeneBay for Toyota’s GRAS-Di®* DNA analysis technology (announced in September 2016), which can dramatically accelerate selective breeding. This technology can
substantially simplify the process of identifying and selecting specimens with useful genetic information, and can be expected to cut cost down to approximately one-third and man-hours by one-tenth, both of which have been major hurdles in previous technologies.
Since November 2017, the technology has been put to practical use in contract-based analysis businesses in Japan and abroad, confirming that currently more than 60 species can be analyzed. GRAS-Di® can be applied to selective breeding in general, not only in agriculture, but for wide-ranging development in other areas.

Assisted Mobility Vehicles

As Japan enters into a period of a super-aging society, government policy is shifting towards home- based medical treatment and nursing care. As a result, there is growing need for assisted mobility that is easy to use at home. Toyota named its assisted mobility vehicles Welcab with the hope of contributing to the happy lives of customers. Our goal is to make vehicles that are comfortable and safe as well as
simple and easy-to-use, and that gives people with disabilities and the elderly the freedom of mobility and furthermore accommodates the needs and wants of caregivers.

Organization and Structure
We plan and develop Welcab vehicles based on five development perspectives—ease of getting in and out of the vehicle, comfortable and smooth ride, ease of operation for drivers and caregivers, ease of communication inside the vehicle, and reasonable pricing—while pursuing market needs.
Customers can experience Welcab vehicles firsthand at Welcab stations established at dealers and Heartful Plazas, which are general Welcab exhibit sites, and Welcab consultants are on site to help customers choose the most appropriate vehicle. As of May 2018, there were 250 Welcab Stations and 10 Heartful Plazas in Japan.

Exploring Ways to Make Assisted Mobility Vehicles into Ordinary Vehicles―Bringing User- friendly Functions Closer
In numerous instances, we received customer feedback indicating that customers considered buying a Welcab but chose not to do so because of the high price, because there was no longer any need, or because the customer did not know how long such a vehicle would be necessary. To address these
customer concerns, Toyota is exploring ways to make assisted mobility vehicles into ordinary vehicles in terms of both function and cost.
In FY2018, we launched new models equipped with a new Side Lift-up Tilt Seat vehicle that includes a tilting feature that uses motors to rotate and tilt the second seat forward, helping the passenger get in and out of the vehicle smoothly. Since the Side Lift-up Tilt Seat protrudes minimally outside the vehicle, the passenger can get in and out of the vehicle even when parked in an ordinary parking spot or adjacent to another vehicle.
Furthermore, the size of the footrest is increased, allowing for a more gradual knee angle when getting in and out of the vehicle or when sitting inside the cabin, thereby reducing knee strain.
These Welcab features were newly added to the Voxy, Noah, Esquire, Alphard, and Vellfire. As of May 2018, the Welcab product line included 43 models in 23 vehicle series.
We also offer “Sapotoyo+” (Support Toyota Program goods) such as a product that helps passengers maintain a comfortable posture when getting in and out of the vehicle or while seated in the vehicle, to encourage people with physical disabilities to go out more.

New Wheelchair-adapted Models That Make it Easier to Get in and Out of the Vehicle Were Launched with the Goal of Reducing the Burden on Caregivers
To address the issue of increasing number of families in which seniors are taking care of seniors, Toyota
added Type III to its wheelchair-adapted models (with a Rear Slope type) with the goal of reducing the burden on caregivers.
Type III comes standard with the Welchair, a Toyota-developed original motorized wheelchair. Combining this with the one-touch anchor enables the user to quickly secure or release the wheelchair from an unstrained posture. Moreover, Type III eliminates the need for actions such as going to get the safety belt or squatting inside the cabin, significantly reducing the burden on the caregiver.
This Welcab feature was newly added to the Voxy, Noah, and Esquire.

Weljoin a Large-capacity Microbus for Helping Solve Public Transportation Issues in Japan In Japan where the population is aging, many route buses are being eliminated especially in local cities, robbing ordinary citizens of their freedom of movement. Especially hard hit are the elderly who are losing their means for going to medical clinics or shopping.
Therefore, Toyota focused on the community buses being driven by local volunteers, and developed the Weljoin in order to help popularize these buses.
For these community buses, vehicles with three rows of seats, such as the Noah, are normally used. Consequently, when a passenger needs to get in or out of the third-row seat, the driver must help the passenger by moving the second-row seat. This means, on rainy days, the driver gets wet when helping the passenger get in or out of the vehicle. This kind of burden has made it difficult to secure enough volunteer drivers, putting the community bus system in jeopardy.
In the Weljoin, by removing one of the second-row seats and installing a handrail near the door, we made it possible for passengers to get in and out of the vehicle without assistance, thereby reducing the burden on the driver.
Toyota’s assisted mobility vehicles, which were started based on the concept of “providing freedom of moving in comfort to all people,” are facing a new phase. In the future, we are planning to help establish social systems, such as community buses, in which volunteers play an active role.

Initiatives in the Sports Field
Toyota has been active in corporate sports and engaged in long term and multi support for athletes since its founding in 1937. The main objectives are to promote company unity, higher motivation among employees, and developing better businesspeople. In the area of sponsoring athletes without disabilities,
Toyota is focusing its support on existing sports clubs. Additionally, after becoming a Paralympic partner, Toyota is providing support to athletes with disabilities by co-sponsoring Boccia and wheelchair basketball leagues.
More than 50 Team Toyota athletes from 20 countries competed at the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 held in PyeongChang in South Korea. Team Toyota athletes consisted of Toyota employees, as well as athletes selected from around the world who shared Toyota's philosophy and core values—be a natural challenger, represent the kaizen (continuous improvement) spirit and
be a team player, etc. To show their support for Team Toyota athletes who share these core values, many employees participated in cheering for the athletes and public viewing events. In addition to hiring these athletes as employees, Toyota is helping the development of equipment for athletes with Toyota’s specialty in monozukuri (manufacturing). The sit-ski used by Taiki Morii, silver medalist at the PyeongChang 2018 Paralympic Winter Games held in PyeongChang, was developed jointly by Toyota and Nissin Medical Industries. This ski was around 15% lighter than existing models but achieved approximately three times the rigidity.

Afforestation Activities in the Fengning Manchu Autonomous County, Hebei Province, China (China) China is facing the serious issue of desertification caused by overgrazing of livestock. Desertification has been expanding in areas near Beijing as well, and the Chinese government is taking this seriously. TMC has been conducting an initiative since 2001, in collaboration with partners such as the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, to stop desertification over 3,000 ha of land in Xiaobazi Township, Fengning Manchu Autonomous County, Hebei Province, an area at the front line of desertification near Beijing. The initiative carries out countermeasures for the causes of desertification
and conducts tree-planting events to improve the lives of local residents. This will lead to the economic independence of local residents even after the support ends through income from timber (and growing fruit trees or medicinal plants). This “sustainable forest” model also includes reinvesting part of the profits into new afforested areas.
In 2011, management of the program was transferred to the local affiliate, which has carried out afforestation on 300 ha so far in the Nanshakouzi region of Fengning Manchu Autonomous County. TMC and Toyota’s Chinese affiliates have been working together,
with a total of more than 1,500 employee volunteers, planting
around 7,000
trees by 2017.
 
Traffic Safety Activities for Children in Thailand (Thailand) TMT has promoted a traffic safety campaign called the White Road Project (which implies “safe road” in Thai) since 1988. Since 2004, TMT has been creating White Road Theme Parks where children can enjoy learning about traffic safety in Bangkok and several
other places. Starting in 2005, TMT has carried out a traffic safety education program that sends mascots from “Milky Way and the Gang” to elementary schools nationwide, where they distribute cartoon videos as a traffic safety campaign.
Starting in 2011, TMT has been working with dealers to roll out a traffic safety campaign targeted at the younger generation and new drivers.
Starting in 2013, TMT has been working with the Thai Department of Land Transport to establish a five-day training program targeted at all dealer trainers, working to increase awareness of safe driving. These activities have been going on for three decades as of 2017, with the cooperation of the Thai Ministry of Education, Royal Thai Police, Ministry of Transport, and other organizations. Its initiatives have been acclaimed by the Thai government.

Activities to Improve the Toyota Production System (U.S.) The TSSC (Toyota Production System Support Center) was established in 1992 in Lexington, Kentucky (now relocated to Erlanger, KY), which has, as a part of its mission, “Contribute to society by sharing Toyota Production System (TPS) knowledge with public institutions and especially manufacturing in North America.” The TSSC shares expertise on the TPS and supported more than 300 organizations, including public bodies, medical institutes, and non-profits involved in disaster recovery and supplying food to those affected. It carries out support for solving operational issues, maximizing the use of resources, individual process improvement activities that lead to the maintenance and creation of employment. In 2017, the TSSC celebrated its 25th anniversary with a ceremony at TMNA, our North American affiliate.
“We see strong opportunity in organizations in sectors other than automotive or manufacturing, and are excited to see how TSSC can collaborate with them to help improve processes, maximize operations, build more resilient communities, and serve more people,” said Chris Nielsen, TMC Executive General Manager, also responsible for TSSC, quality and product support in TMNA.

Tag Rugby Classes (Japan)
Toyota City has been chosen as one of the venues for the Rugby World Cup which will be held in Japan in 2019, and the local area is excited about this opportunity. On request from the city, Toyota Verblitz rugby players instruct tag rugby to elementary school children in the city (participated by 4,310 people in 43 schools in total).
In addition, employees in their third year at the company are also taking part as volunteers to help the event, as part of their training program.
Tag rugby is a sport where people grab the tags attached to the waists of other players, instead of tackling. This is seen as an appropriate first step for allowing schoolchildren to become familiar with rugby balls.
The tag rugby classes both contribute to children growing up healthy, and serve as one of our activities to connect our employees (as athletes and volunteers) with the local community.
 
Support for Flood Damage in Durban (South Africa) Toyota is working to help regions around the world affected by disasters to recover. In addition to monetary donations in case a disaster strikes, we also provide material support and volunteers, helping the region recover as soon as possible.
In October 2017, Durban in South Africa was affected by massive flooding, with 11 dead, and 5 hospitals and 42 schools damaged. Toyota plants and dealers were also affected, but Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM) quickly formed a recovery support team.
More than a hundred employee volunteers helped rebuild of a total of 20 primary and junior high schools.
TSAM’s general manager, Jenny Mare, said that “This flooding was worse than we’ve ever experienced, but the recovery work carried out by our staff and the local people was amazing.” Employee volunteers also noted that “We were able to draw on the Toyota spirit of tackling difficulties through working as a team.”

Toyota ABCD Programme for Installing Toilets in Elementary Schools (India)
There are still 250 million people in India who have to pass their waste outdoors. This unhygienic toilet situation ruins living environments and increases the spread of infectious diseases. The lack of toilets leads to children refusing to go to school.
The lack of toilets is caused by financial aspects, as it would take about half of the annual income to prepare a toilet in their home. Also toilets are thought of as unclean and should be cleaned by the lower castes. This means outdoor toilets are more convenient.
However, the children have raised their voices, launching a complaint demanding toilets at home. This complaint was spurred by the Toyota ABCD* Programme, promoted by Toyota’s Indian affiliate, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM). In this program, an NPO group partnered with TKM regularly visits local schools, teaching children about the importance of washing hands and how outdoor toilet waste has negative effects on hygiene, and telling them that the government will subsidize toilet installation. TKM started this program to match the strong efforts by the Modi administration, which came to power in 2014, in increasing the number of toilets.
TKM’s vice president, Naveen Soni, believes that changing people’s values and customs related to toilets needs to be done to develop an environment where toilets can be used hygienically. In addition to installing toilets in schools, TKM has also started activities to encourage children to clean toilets by themselves.
So far, 30,000 children in 180 villages in southern India, where TKM is based, have learned through the Toyota ABCD Programme. Its scope of activities is increasing with the backup of local authorities. TKM is receiving more requests from local schools.

Cultivating People Who Can Inherit the Roots of Monozukuri from a Medium- to Long-term Perspective

●	Human Resource Development

Toyota Technological Institute: Cultivating International Industrial Leaders (Japan) Kiichiro Toyoda realized that “To develop our country, it is important that we cultivate people who can support science and technology.” When he founded the company, his dream was to establish an
institute of higher learning at the time of company prosperity.” When the Institute was founded, in 1981,
its founding principle was taken from the Five Main Principles of Toyoda, “Always be studious and creative, striving to stay ahead of the times,” which is based on the legacy of Sakichi Toyoda. As part of the company’s commitment to give back to the community, the Institute was founded as Japan’s first “university for working adults,” targeted at actual workers dispatched from their companies.
After starting to accept young students in 1993, the Institute now has both young students and working adult students studying together. Since its founding, the Institute has been training highly creative engineers proficient in practical development skills through small-group instruction, and a curriculum rich in experiments and hands-on training has been provided.
In addition to the existing fields of Mechanical Systems Engineering, Electronics and Information Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and so on, three unique centers—Smart Vehicles, Smart Energy Technology, and Smart Optics and Materials have been established. In addition, through links with our sister school, the Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), we are putting our efforts into AI and computer science. We also aim to establish and expand a “Human Life Advanced Technology” (science and technology to support human lifestyles) as a compound, merged advanced research field based on Advanced Hybrid Engineering.
To further energize our research, we are also developing a Research Faculty system aimed at training young faculty members and energizing human resources, as well as an overseas training system. TTI has maintained a 100 percent student employment rate, contributing to the development of society through monozukuri (manufacturing) in leading companies within each field in the industrial world.

Respect for Human Rights

Fundamental Approach  In its Guiding Principles at Toyota, Contribution towards Sustainable Development (CSR Policy) and the Toyota
Code of Conduct, Toyota states the concept of respecting and honoring the human rights and other rights of all people. Moreover, the Toyota Way lays out the values that employees working at Toyota should share, based on the Guiding Principles at Toyota.
Of the two pillars of the Toyota Way—“Continuous Improvement” and “Respect for People”—Respect for People means to respect all stakeholders as well as to respect the character and abilities of employees as individuals. It also facilitates personal achievement by linking the personal growth of employees to company performance.
The Toyota Way is considered a shared value for all our affiliates around the world. While referencing each nation’s laws and customs as well as various international guidelines and norms such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we promote various activities to provide employees with secure and attractive workplaces as well as aiming to respond to the expectations of our stakeholders. Toyota makes efforts so that these concepts are put into practice throughout Toyota’s global business activities, which include subsidiaries and suppliers.
For details on the Toyota Way, please see page 6.



Major Initiatives during FY2018

TMC
TMC established the Consolidated Compliance Program to check whether respect for human rights is shown in daily work. Self-checks and follow-ups are implemented targeting respective functions each year.
 

Subsidiaries in Japan and Overseas
Toyota requests the implementation of self-checks in the Consolidated Compliance Program once a year for its subsidiaries in Japan and once every two years for overseas subsidiaries. Since 2012, subsidiaries have been requested to propose and implement improvement measures for addressing human rights and labor issues based on the results of the self-checks. In 2017, self-checks were conducted at our domestic and overseas subsidiaries and requests for improvements were made based on necessity amongst them.
 

Suppliers
Toyota developed and rolled out the Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines in 2009, which describe policies and approaches to human rights, along with expectations of suppliers. The suppliers are requested to conduct self-checks in accordance with the guidelines. At the end of 2012, the Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines were revised. Since then, regarding human rights and labor, which are considered prioritized items, confirmation of status, requests for improvement, and monitoring of improvement activities as needed have been conducted through the distribution and collection of questionnaires. So far, the questionnaires have been distributed to our suppliers in Japan and overseas (approximately 3,000 companies), and improvement requests were made to suppliers as necessary.
 

Dealers
In Japan, the Toyota National Dealers’ Advisory Council (TNDAC) which is comprised of Toyota dealers, voluntarily developed and issued the TNDAC CSR Guidelines in 2005. The guidelines include Toyota’s compliance policies. As a specific action for improvement, each dealer checks the items related to human rights and labor in the CSR Check List and executes PDCA. Each dealer’s annual activities are shared with TNDAC.

Organization and Structure
Toyota is responding to changes such as growing demands concerning human rights, by continuously enhancing and reviewing its corporate initiatives.
For example, in conjunction with the reinforcement and revision of international guidelines on due diligence, a Human Rights Working Group was established in 2011 to incorporate various functions including corporate planning (now Corporate Affairs), overseas external affairs, audit, legal, accounting, human resources and purchasing to study international guidelines and measures that Toyota should take. We hold Sustainability Meetings to discuss the expectations of our stakeholders and human rights issues. We ensure a structure where both the company and society can grow sustainably by studying, strengthening measures, and revising activities to put into actual practice.

Sharing and Applying Policies on Respect for Human Rights
 
Toyota’s Approaches to Conflict Minerals Issues

Toyota is taking various measures to realize protection of human rights.
Civilians in certain regions around the world are being subjected to massacres, plunder, abduction, conscription of child soldiers, and other inhumane conduct as a result of armed conflict, thereby giving rise to international condemnation. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is located in central Africa, the unlawful mining and smuggling of the country’s abundant mineral resources is said to be a major source of funding for armed groups.
Toyota undertakes business with a strong awareness that violations of human rights, environmental degradation, unlawful mining, and other issues in these conflict regions as well as the issue of minerals that provide sources of funding to armed groups through such actions are major social issues concerning the supply chain. Toyota has conducted a reasonable country of origin inquiry with due diligence for its products since May 2013. A report summing up the survey results for the period between January and December of 2017 was compiled in the 2017 Form SD and Conflict Minerals Report* and submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 31, 2018.
We aim at procurement and usage that are free from conflict minerals originated in the DRC or an adjoining country and relating to illegal conduct including human rights infringement. For that purpose, Toyota will work together with parts suppliers, automotive industry organizations and other relevant organizations.


Toyota’s Policy on Conflict Minerals
Toyota has adopted Policies and Approaches to Conflict Minerals Issues—a set of guidelines the company is supposed to refer to in tackling conflict minerals issues. Based on the guidelines, Toyota is dealing with the issues. Meanwhile, the company revised the Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines in 2012, asking its suppliers to engage in responsible material procurement.

Establishment of an In-house System, Industry-to-industry Collaboration, and Participation in Public-private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA)
In 2011, Toyota launched a cross sectional task force in charge of dealing with conflict minerals issues. The team, formally called the Conflict Minerals task force, consists of representatives from relevant departments such as corporate planning (current corporate affairs), purchasing, accounting, public relations, external affairs, legal, and material engineering within the company. The team has begun considering what actions are to be taken regarding conflict minerals.
Also in 2011, Toyota set up a working group on conflict minerals jointly with the JAPIA1. The move represented the domestic automotive industry-wide efforts to cope with issues associated with conflict minerals. In 2012, Toyota and its parts suppliers belonging to the JAPIA joined hands in conducting a trial-based survey on conflict minerals used in their products, kicking off their preparations for launching full-fledged investigation into the issues. In 2013, the Japan Conflict-free Sourcing Working Group was established by automakers and companies belonging to the JEITA2. Main activities undertaken by the Japan Conflict-free Sourcing Working Group include the investigation of identity regarding firms engaging in smelting in conflicted areas and making visits to organizations representing smelters. The association has been also pressing for smelters to obtain a certificate confirming that minerals they use in their products are DRC conflict-free.
Toyota’s efforts to work with other industry groups on the issue of conflict minerals are not limited to activities in Japan. Toyota has been working globally to deal with the issue. For example, the company has participated in a working group set up by the AIAG3, a U.S. group tasked with setting code of conduct for the auto industry. Toyota has been also cooperating with the RMI4 through activities of each working group. Through AIAG, we supported and contributed to RMI activities.
Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (TMNA), a U.S. subsidiary of Toyota, contacted 45 smelters/refiners between January and December, 2017, as Leader of AIAG’s Smelter Engagement Team, and contacted an additional 7 smelters/refiners in addition to the 45 above as Team-Lead of the Global Smelter Engagement Teams Working Group. They performed surveys of smelters and encouraged them to participate in the
 
Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). TMNA also joined the European Smelter Engagement Team in order to further identify and engage more smelters/refiners.
In addition, Toyota participated in Phase 1 of the Public-private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA5), a multi-sector initiative whose members include the U.S. government, industry organizations and citizen groups. The PPA encourages responsible minerals trade that is free from material procurement
in certain areas marred by regional conflict, including the DRC or an adjoining country, and coordinates support to organizations engaged in the critical work to develop conflict-free supply chains.
Toyota agrees with the spirit of the PPA’s efforts, and considers resolving issues that may hinder the trading of legitimate mineral resources in those countries. For this purpose, it refrains from requesting suppliers to not use any minerals in the area, regardless of their relation to human rights violations. Based on that awareness, it believes promoting initiatives industry-wide for use of materials that are free from conflict at smelters who are upstream in the supply chain is one way to resolve human right infringement issues and ultimately develop a more civil society.
As a result of the industry-wide cooperation outlined above, the number of conflict-free smelters and refiners worldwide has been increased to 250 as of November 20176. Toyota has confirmed that 249 out of those 250 conflict-free smelters were named by our suppliers in response to our request for the 2017 survey.

Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry

■ Details of Surveys Implemented in 2017
In May 2013, Toyota launched a full-scale reasonable country of origin inquiry. Since then, the survey has been conducted globally, covering its subsidiaries operating both in Japan and abroad. In 2017, Toyota carried out the survey for all kinds of business undertaken by Toyota, including automobiles and marine transportation equipment. Tracing back through our supply chains globally, suppliers operating in Japan and overseas were asked to check if conflict minerals have made their way into the supply chains of their products.
We contacted suppliers who had not submitted a Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), and collected CMRTs from thousands of suppliers in total. We have reviewed suppliers’ CMRTs and
requested them to make corrections if there are errors and/or omissions in order to effectively improve our efforts associated with conflict minerals.
Before the survey began, Toyota held a briefing session for suppliers while formulating a manual detailing how to fill in the survey sheet and developing a tool used to compile survey results. Also, Toyota supported a briefing session co-sponsored by JAPIA and JEITA. Further, we have been collaborating with our suppliers via regular communications, made possible by our strong and close relationships. As we have been closely communicating with major Tier-1 suppliers, some of the feedback we received from them was integrated into conflict minerals survey-related materials, such as survey manuals, FAQs
and other tools. Those materials are provided to suppliers free of charge, with the aim to provide support on the survey.
In addition, Toyota has been doing its due diligence regarding identification of the origin of minerals being used by its suppliers, and their distribution and production processes in line with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-affected and High-risk Areas.
Based on the risks identified through the due diligence, the issue has been discussed at the management level, then the company designed and implemented a strategy to respond to such risk, which was documented as a risk management plan.
For domestic and overseas suppliers for Toyota brand and Lexus brand vehicles, we have identified priority suppliers for following up to mitigate the identified risk in accordance with the internally-developed criteria and procedures.
 
instances the 2017 survey was not able to identify smelters/refiners and mines in upstream portions of the supply chain. For further information on the survey results, please see below.
As for an in-house system for handling the inquiries on details of survey results, it is designed that all the inquiries we receive from outside parties are raised to the Conflict Minerals task force and discussed among the members of the team.
Results of Surveys Implemented in FY2018
 
Conflict Minerals’ Country of Origin

 
Because sufficient information to identify a portion of the smelters/refiners and the countries of origin of conflict minerals was not provided by its suppliers, Toyota was unable to determine if any of its products to be DRC conflict-free.

 
Facilities Used to Process Conflict Minerals

 
During the course of our due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the necessary conflict minerals, Toyota has collected information on some, but not all, of its smelters/refiners. Among those smelters/refiners, we found some of them processed minerals sourced in the DRC or an adjoining country. However, through our due diligence, we were unable to obtain sufficient information to determine whether those conflict minerals were from mines which financed or benefited any armed group.

 


Future Efforts
Toyota aims to become a company which does not use conflict minerals originating from the DRC or an adjoining country that were mined and sold under the control of armed forces to finance conflict and violation of human rights, as materials for their products. Toyota has pledged to become DRC conflict free in collaboration with suppliers. Toyota finds it necessary to establish the environment that enables implementation of survey and due diligence through gathering information on smelters and lobbying to organizations of smelters. For that environment to be created, Toyota will work with industry and other groups.
 

■ Results of Surveys Implemented in 2017
The 2017 survey results were incorporated into Form SD and the Conflict Minerals Report, which have been filed with the SEC. Automobile supply chains are broad and complex, and as a result, in many

Collaboration with Suppliers

Since its establishment, Toyota has worked closely with its suppliers in its manufacturing. As part of these efforts, Toyota has globally implemented its Basic Purchasing Policies according to the spirit of mutual benefit based on mutual trust. We have close relationships with existing and new suppliers to promote “Customer First.”
To address the increasing interest in corporate social responsibility, including supply chain, we have dialogues with supplier executives. Internally, we work to raise the awareness of all our employees, including buyers, through seminars and trainings.
Toyota is also committed to continue contributing to the sustainability of society and the earth by working with suppliers to ensure compliance, respect for human rights, and reduce negative environmental impact.
 
Implementation of the Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines
At Toyota, we believe it is important to cooperate with suppliers, and issued the Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines in February 2009. Toyota suppliers are requested to implement their own CSR activities based on the Guidelines and in turn develop their individual CSR policies and guidelines to their own suppliers. Furthermore, in December 2012, Toyota revised the guidelines to indicate its principles regarding human rights issues (strengthening of monitoring and corrective actions, and approaches towards conflict minerals) in order to enhance CSR initiatives.
 



 


Respecting Human Rights
The Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines indicate the policy of respecting human rights and what is expected of suppliers.
Furthermore, as part of efforts to strengthen its initiatives regarding human rights and labor issues, Toyota created a questionnaire for assessment at each supplier. When necessary, Toyota requests improvement and monitoring of improvement activities as needed.

Promoting Environmental Activities
As Toyota believes that it is important to work with its suppliers to carry out environmental activities, the Toyota Green Purchasing Guidelines has been introduced.
In January 2016, Toyota published a revised edition based on the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050. The main revisions include enhancing initiatives such as for greenhouse gases (GHG) and biodiversity, reinforcing lifecycle perspectives and strengthening the supply chain management.

Approaches towards Conflict Minerals Issue
Based on its Policies and Approaches to Conflict Minerals Issues, Toyota strives to procure conflict-free raw materials that do not involve human rights infringements or other abuses. We conduct investigations that trace global supply chains and take measures to avoid use in cases where there are concerns that raw materials are being used as a source of funds for armed groups.
 

Bribery Prevention
In response to the global expansion of its business and societal demands, Toyota adopted the Anti- Bribery Guidelines in 2012 to completely eliminate corruption. Toyota is strengthening its preventive measures by deploying the Guidelines to our suppliers.




Suppliers’ CSR Activities
To promote CSR, Toyota suppliers voluntarily hold CSR lectures and workshops, and engage in volunteer activities.
CSR lectures are held every year by Toyota’s supplier associations, Kyohokai and Eihokai, with the aim of improving member companies’ awareness and understanding and encouraging CSR initiatives. In July of FY2018, Toyota held a lecture titled “Requirements for Successful Work Style Innovation.” Japan is facing a variety of labor-related issues, including long work hours, productivity, and worker shortages. It
provided an opportunity to recognize the importance of work style innovation, such as creating a society
 
In FY2018, a CSR Study Meeting was held and 450 persons from 350 suppliers attended. The topic was a legal issue, “trends and initiatives in fair trading.” Toyota participates in the supplier CSR training program of the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG)* to support its overseas suppliers in their activities to promote CSR. In the previous fiscal year, Toyota participated in the development of the Supplier Responsibility Training Project. This new e-learning program is available to suppliers on AIAG website. Toyota will continue working to help raise awareness of CSR across its supply chains.

Dealers are the front line where Toyota’s “Customer First” policy is directly observed. Toyota and its dealers share the value of its products/services and always work as one to enhance customer satisfaction based on a strong relationship of trust through close two-way communication.

●	Domestic Dealers
 
J-ReBORN Plan Aiming to Revitalize Japan with Dealers
To respond to changes in the Japanese automotive market due to depopulation, aging, a shrinking market and technological advances, Toyota is promoting the J-ReBORN Plan, a new domestic sales strategy.
The plan is rooted in the idea of using the nationwide dealer network to revitalize Japan. Toyota promotes “Ever-better Dealerships” and is working to attract every stakeholder including customers. Toyota is taking on the challenge of making more car fans.
 

The Toyota domestic sales network comprises 281 dealers, operating around 5,500 locations (including used car outlets, as of July 2018).
Under the Customer First policy, we have a “Customer First, Dealer Second, Manufacturer Third” concept. Toyota supports dealers in making concerted efforts to meet customer expectations in order to raise the level of customer satisfaction. We believe that, through these efforts, we will realize growth for both dealers and Toyota.

Support of Toyota Dealers in Japan
The Toyota National Dealers’ Advisory Council (TNDAC) established the CSR Study Group and created the TNDAC CSR Guidelines in 2005. In the following year, TNDAC adopted the Toyota Dealers CSR Declaration and have been promoting unified CSR activities involving all Toyota dealers in Japan ever since.
In 2016, the CSR Study Group was reorganized into the Compliance Study Group, which has been studying to ensure legal compliance and giving suggestions to all Toyota dealers.
Additionally, to help dealers carry out compliance activities, TNDAC distributes the CSR Checklist made up of nearly 400 items to dealers each year.
Toyota supports TNDAC and dealers, including the following:
•	Setting up a compliance support website that lists best practices from dealers
•	Providing information through seminars and lectures held by TNDAC
•	Supporting revisions of the CSR Checklist in accordance with legislative amendments

Dealer Staff Participating in Soccer Instructions through the JFA Youth & Development Programme (Japan)
In May 2017, Toyota signed a JFA Youth & Development Programme (JYD) partnership agreement with the Japan Football Association (JFA). As an official JYD supporter, Toyota is supporting soccer instruction activities for preschoolers nationwide.
JYD is a program that JFA has been running since January 2016, with the goals of continuous development of soccer and its players in Japan.
Staff members of nationwide Toyota dealers, parts distributors, and rental & leasing companies obtain the JFA Official Kids Leader license. Since July 2017, they have been offering classes for kids in local kindergartens, nursery schools, etc. to teach soccer skills as well as the joy of sports, in collaboration with soccer associations in individual prefectures.
In FY2018, the program provided onsite instruction to 8,363 children at 263 kindergartens and nursery schools.
The goal of these activities is to help the next generation to grow up healthy in mind and body.

Signing of an agreement in May 2017
 
Toyota Gentaiken Program
The Toyota Gentaiken Program aims to nurture future car fans by providing children of the “virtual era” with opportunities to gain real-life experience using five senses and to experience the global environment and economy. This program works together with local dealers to offer “traveling classrooms” at elementary schools in the area.
The theme of the classroom activities is to offer fun and hands-on experiences. The class for fourth graders teaches about the power and control of a car using a model and real car in Car Gentaiken Class. The class for fifth graders is the Class to Fully Understand Cars, which teaches the students about the relationship of cars with environment and economics using quizzes or games, as part of learning about the automotive industry in their social studies class.
In FY2018, the Car Gentaiken Class was conducted at 117 schools and the Class to Fully Understand Cars at 336 schools, for a total of 453 schools. Since starting in 2008, the program has provided classroom activities to approximately 160,000 children in 3,267 schools.

TOYOTA SOCIAL FES!! (TSF)
AQUA SOCIAL FES!! (ASF), which was started in 2012 to encourage environmental activities following the launch of the Aqua hybrid vehicle, was renamed TOYOTA SOCIAL FES (TSF). The name change reflects the expansion of the activity theme from aqua (water) to the environment for the next generation, with the goal of improving local communities and the future.
With the hope of creating a brighter future, infused into the Mirai fuel-cell vehicle, the Prius PHV, and widely popular hybrid vehicles, TSF carries out a variety of action programs in all 47 prefectures in Japan, from Hokkaido to Okinawa.
Toyota is in charge of the overall TSF planning, promotion and operation. Developing and running the action programs are carried out by regional NPOs and local newspapers. Recently, TSF has been making changes. For example, local governments municipalities are including environmental restoration costs in their budget and local corporations are utilizing TSF in their employee training.
There are 10,000 participants in TSF events each year. In the summer of 2018, seventh year of the events, the cumulative total of participants exceeded 70,000. The average age of the participants is 30.5, and the activities are varied, including the clean-up of rivers, lakes, seas and mountains; extermination of invasive species; tree planting; and revitalization of terraced rice paddies and satoyama.
Nearly 90 percent of the participants answered positively about the program, saying, “I got interested in the local area” or “I want to participate again.”
 
Onsite Visit from Toyota Dealers Overseas
Every year, Toyota dealers from all over the world visit Toyota dealers in Japan to learn customer satisfaction (CS) activities. They learn how Japanese dealers improve customer satisfaction and create more Toyota fans throughout the entire value chain, including new car sales, service, insurance, used cars, and credit. After genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience), they incorporate what they have learned into various activities at their own dealers.
Through active communication among dealers with different cultural backgrounds, these visits offer each dealer new ideas.

●	Overseas Distributors

The overseas distributors are important Toyota partners in providing ever-better cars for customers worldwide. Toyota has approximately 170 distributors and 10,000 dealers overseas that are creating Toyota fans through their involvement in the local community.

Organization and Structure
Toyota’s sales operations are divided into six regions (excluding Japan) throughout the world: North America, Europe, China & Asia, East Asia/Oceania & the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America & Caribbean, to provide the best cars and services according to the market characteristics of each region. The car usage conditions and environment, as well as the required functions and services, can vary greatly depending on the country and region. Toyota strives to comprehend customer feedback in a timely manner through overseas dealers, in order to make ever-better cars.
Furthermore, in order to realize product planning, sales strategies, and local sales promotion activities that respond better to these different local needs, Toyota reorganized its business units in 2013. Toyota No. 1 was in charge of developed nations where car markets had matured and replacement demand and products with advanced technologies were required. Toyota No. 2 was in charge of emerging nations where prompt introduction of products were needed to meet exploding market needs and acquire new customers.
Afterwards, as environmental regulations and the business environment change in various countries, Toyota in April 2017 reorganized, integrating Toyota No. 1 and Toyota No. 2 into the Business Planning & Operation Unit, which coordinate with the product-based in-house companies. This change is designed to enable rapid and effective responses to customer needs.
Under this organization, Toyota further enhanced its cooperation with distributors in each country and region to deliver ever-better cars that meet the needs of customers in each market.
 
Since 1984, a World Convention has been held every four years to bring together overseas distributors and executives of Toyota. At this convention, Toyota expresses its appreciation for the hard work and shares its policies, to make it an opportunity to reaffirm further improvement of customer satisfaction.




Environmental Initiatives in Collaboration with Domestic and Overseas Dealers and Distributors Toyota is working with domestic and overseas dealers and distributors to create environmentally-friendly dealers and members to lower environmental risks through sales activities.

Fundamental Approach  Toyota's philosophy for its employees, who are supporting the stable base of business, is institutionalized as The Toyota Way in Human Resources Management.
The aim of the Toyota Way in Human Resources Management is to realize management with respect for people, that is, providing all employees with opportunities to achieve social contribution and self-realization through their work, and enabling them to exercise their abilities to think, to be creative, and to perform. For this aim to be achieved, “a relationship of mutual trust and mutual responsibility between labor and management*” is essential, in which the company gives the highest priority to ensure stable employment and strives to improve labor conditions, while all employees execute their duties and responsibilities for the prosperity of the company. This philosophy is shared by all Toyota affiliates around the world. Based on the features of each region, it is reflected and implemented in management and various policies. Toyota believes that these initiatives will not only lead to the management with respect for people, but also to customer satisfaction and social contribution, and thus the sustainable growth of the company and society.


Concept of the Toyota Way in Human Resources Management to Build a Good Working Environment







Nurturing teamwork that aims to
ensure the fulﬁllment of individual
roles and optimization of the whole





Organization and Structure
At Toyota, Global HR members discuss how to create good working environments where employees can work with trust, how to develop frameworks to enhance constant and proactive kaizen (continuous improvement), how to develop people, and how to create a sense of unity for teamwork through daily communication and periodic conferences.
These discussions are reflected to Global HR Priorities (HRFP) and each affiliate’s HR hoshin the following year in order to realize The Toyota Way in Human Resources Management.

Results of Employee Satisfaction Survey
By providing its employees with opportunities to achieve social contribution and self-realization through their work, Toyota aims to enable all employees to exercise their abilities to think, to be creative, and to perform. Toyota uses its employee satisfaction surveys to measure the results of these efforts and utilizes the analysis results for planning and implementing measures to make a better workplace.
The employee satisfaction survey conducted in FY2017 of administrative and engineering employees indicated that 78.0 percent were satisfied with their company life. The most common reason given was the “work quality and level” followed by “pay level” and “human relations at the workplace.”

Safety and Health

Fundamental Approach  Ensuring safety and health of employees is one of Toyota’s most important business activities from the past and the future. Upon assuming the position of General Safety and Health
Supervisor in 1957, then Senior Managing Officer Eiji Toyoda explained his basic stance on safety and health: “Safe work is the ‘gate’ to all work. Let us pass through this gate.” Toyota has handed these words down as the basic philosophy for safety and health, incorporating the strong desire for employees to never be involved in an occupational accident.
This is why we are using the PDCA* cycle to improve priority policies implemented under the leadership of company-wide safety and health managers as part of our overall health and safety activities.
For health promotion, we discuss the results of our activities done in accordance with our policies with the Toyota Motor Health Insurance Society, labor unions and industrial health personnel (human resources, safety & health) to take health support measures. In September 2017, President Akio Toyoda announced the Declaration of Health Commitment: Aiming at Health First Company. This Declaration states that the physical and mental health of our employees is the “driving force for good performance,” and so Toyota actively supports the “challenge to improve your lifestyle” for each employee and works on initiatives for “health promotion & illness prevention activity.”
For these issues of safety and health, the Safety & Health Environment Subcommittee chaired by the executive vice president (once a year) and the Discussion Group chaired by the general manager of the Safety & Health Promotion Division hold meetings to work on issue-solving through company-union cooperation.

Global Safety Measures
Toyota regional headquarters are mainly promoting safety and health measures in each region. We are currently working with each region to develop an occupational safety and health management system (OSHMS1) globally. Along with unique regional requirements, we have established requirements that are shared throughout global Toyota based on ISO 450012. Using OSHMS, weaknesses are identified by genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience) to improve safety management.
Toyota also holds an annual global safety meeting, attended by managers responsible for safety and health. By studying measures for common issues and sharing information on unique activities and best practices, the conference participants are able to raise the level of safety and health activities in each region.
1	OSHMS: Occupational Safety and Health Management System
2	ISO 45001: The international standard related to occupational health and safety management systems established by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization)

 
Promoting a Three-pillar Approach to Safety
Toyota has promoted the establishment of a culture that promotes interactive development of safety and health in its safety and health function policy and is taking measures to elevate safety. We are implementing initiatives to promote compliance with basic rules with executives and managers taking leadership and all employees participating so that employees are aware of the risks and take preventive

action proactively. In FY2018, the rate of lost-workday cases was 0.59 (down 1.7 percent from the previous fiscal year). We will continue taking action to eventually achieve zero accidents and the continuation of zero accidents at all worksites and will intensify efforts regarding the three pillars of safety: human resource development (raising awareness of hazards through education and on-the-job training and conducting programs with the participation of all personnel), risk management (development of safety management systems), and environmental and facility preparation (provision of safe machinery and comfortable workplace environments).

Genchi Genbutsu at Overseas Affiliates
Toyota’s Head Office has worked together with the headquarters of each region and does genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience) to confirm the safety status of overseas affiliates based on OSHMS. Toyota promotes improvements in safety by using this system and method to clearly identify any issues.
For example, we confirm if measures are implemented to avoid same accidents that have occurred at the sites of other affiliates, and if a system has been created to make the effort active and continuous.
Furthermore, successful examples of effective measures and activities are introduced and used at the sites of other affiliates.

   
China: Check on construction sites	Europe: Check on equipment improvement activities



Creating a Safe Work Environment for On-premise Business Partners (Construction, Contracting, Outsourcing, Delivery, etc.) (Japan)
At Toyota, improvements to the work environment are made by providing opportunities to communicate
and tackle each issue to ensure safety for business partners on the premises.
For example, when performing routine cleaning and inspection of equipment, improvements are made, such as adding lights for dark work spaces or placing gripping on slippery footholds.
We will continue to carry out improvements globally to solve problems confronted by actual workers.
 
Building Up Good Health (Japan)
Toyota adopted the development of healthy people and healthy worksites as a company-wide policy and in FY2018 promoted the Healthy Lifestyles Challenge 8 program. This program encourages employees to make improvements in their health-related practices in eight areas to maintain and enhance their mental and physical health: (1) appropriate weight (BMI), (2) breakfast, (3) drinking, (4) snacking, (5) exercise, (6) smoking, (7) sleep, and (8) stress. The aim is to develop mentally and physically healthy people, encouraging each employee to try one or more issue to raise awareness and adopt healthier practices.
Specific measures include providing individual reports indicating the status of implementing the eight health-related practices within the results of medical exams. Healthy Lifestyles Challenge 8
Implementation Sheets indicate targets and weekly status to encourage awareness of and action for health development by each individual.
In addition, feedback on organization analysis results is provided to each division to clearly show where the low levels of implementation are. Other worksite support such as exercise instruction and health lectures is provided to promote the development of health-related custom and culture at each workplace. In addition, company cafeterias are offering low-calorie, nutritionally-balanced meals to support improvement in eating habits. Workplace environment is also improved to prevent second-hand smoke. We are deploying the Toyota Health Handbook, medical exam data and health promotion records as tools to support employee self-management and improvement.

Mental Health Care Activities (Japan)
To actively promote good mental health, TMC conducts Self-care Training and Line Care Training with the aim of preventing mental health problems from either occurring or recurring.
Self-care Training targets new and young employees and helps raise awareness on how to identify warning signs and deal with stress. Line Care Training includes psychological training for managers, training for newly-appointed general managers to go through case studies. Listener Training is for supervisors who directly supervise subordinates. Trainees receive advice on how to communicate at workplaces and collaborate with industrial health personnel.
We established internal guidelines on health consultations for industrial health care staff and have been working to standardize and systematize the details of consultations and responses.
In addition, Workplace Return Support Guidelines are enacted companywide, with revisions made to the support systems for leave and return to work. By doing this, employees, their doctors, in-house physicians, persons in charge of health and safety, persons in charge of HR and colleagues have better communication routes to work together. We provide support to facilitate the smooth return to work by employees and after their return.

Health Management of Overseas Personnel
Healthcare institutions available vary depending on the region, so we provide health management support accordingly.
In FY2018, we continued to provide health check-ups for personnel assigned overseas with in-house physicians and providing advice via email to follow up on their health.
The local health environments are confirmed through regular exchanges of information with local contact personnel and visits by in-house physicians and others. Health information is provided to locally-stationed employees via the Internet.

Human Resources Development

Fundamental Approach  Toyota is committed to developing human resources with the philosophy that “Monozukuri is about Developing People.” For sustainable growth, we need to make improvements each day.
In order to realize “Ever-better Cars” and “Customer First,” all employees need to share the same values regardless of different cultures and customs. To ensure this, Toyota develops global OJT based on the Toyota Way for sustainable growth.

Five Key Values for The Toyota Way


 
Evaluation of and Feedback to Each Employee in Relation to Principles and Hoshin
Daily work (topics and roles) of Toyota employees are derived from
annual direction (hoshin). Evaluation and feedback are based on close communications between subordinates and superiors.
Specifically, topics and roles are determined at the beginning of
 
Practice of the Toyota Way
We have organized and arranged methods and techniques into “Global Content” to share the values and ways of thinking of The Toyota Way so that it can be understood and practiced by Toyota employees around the world.
This Global Content is practiced by Toyota employees through training and OJT both in Japan and overseas.

List of Global Content

each fiscal year and employees consult with their supervisors periodically. By these consultations, supervisors assess the employees’ self-evaluations and provide feedback. Repeating this cycle leads to human resource development. Results for each half year are reflected in bonuses and performance abilities are
reflected in raises for the following year.

Global Human Resource Development Structures	TMC’s Human Resource Development (Japan)

 
With the aim of sharing the values of the Toyota Way globally, Toyota is providing trainings through global executive human resource development, TMC human resource development undertaken by TMC, and overseas affiliate human resource development undertaken by affiliates in each region.



Global Executive Human Resource Development
The Global 21 Program is to provide skilled global employees with knowledge suitable for global Toyota executives and to exercise their strengths to their best in respective areas of responsibility.
The program comprises the following three pillars.
1.	Indication of management philosophy and expectations of executives
The Toyota Way and Global Vision are disseminated and incorporated into global human resource evaluations and training.
2.	Human resource management
Evaluation standards and processes are standardized globally to ensure fairness and consistency. There are five major areas of evaluation: issue creativity, issue execution capabilities, organizational management capabilities, human resource utilization capabilities and leadership.
3.	Training deployment and training programs
Global assignments and executive training are carried out. Development of human resources at overseas affiliates is based on local training together with OJT at TMC to learn Toyota ways of performing work. TMC’s human resource development includes programs corresponding to Global 21 within TMC training program.
 
Management Human Resource Development
All personnel who are promoted to general manager, department manager, or section manager positions undergo one year training.
The training is based on group training and seminars that include discussions in small groups. Officers and general manager class serve as instructors to foster teaching and a learning culture.
Training for selected managers is also conducted to develop executive human resources candidates. Such personnel perform secretarial work for top officers, attend overseas business schools for short periods, work on management issues, and attend leadership programs for executives in Japan. In this way, opportunities are created for top management to directly observe personnel in these positions and to foster executive minds for the candidates.

Administrative and Engineering Human Resource Development
Practice of the Toyota Way is positioned as the foundation of human resource development. OJT focuses on genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience), while off-the-job training (OFF-JT) opportunities for growth are also created with the guidance of supervisors or superiors. For example, employees first participate in group training to learn steps for problem solving and then apply them to actual issues in their work duties.
In 2015, OJT and OFF-JT were reviewed and improved for newly graduated, young and mid-career employees.
For one year after hiring, new employees undergo comprehensive training on fundamental knowledge in various areas. In the third and sixth to eighth years of employment, young and mid-career employees undergo group training consisting of the five pillars of OJT in accordance with the Global Vision.

Five Pillars of OJT for Young and Mid-career Employees

Specific Measures

Dispatch Program for Young Employees
The dispatch program for young employees overseas was expanded from 2014 to accelerate the early development of young employees.
Employees working for more than four years are dispatched to overseas affiliates, overseas graduate programs (including MBA programs), or domestic affiliates for one to two years. Their mission is to acquire practical skills, deepen understanding of different cultures, and improve their language skills. During FY2019, 328 employees have been dispatched.

Shop Floor Employee Human Resource Development
OJT is conducted by supervisors and superiors at worksites. Focus is placed on the cycle of; clarification of goals and development plans, development and assignment, and evaluation/ feedback. Programs include OFF-JT, including rank-specific training and training for managers/supervisors, as well as OJT and OFF-JT combined to acquire knowledge and techniques.
The workplace environment is changing with a declining birth rate and aging population, a shrinking workforce, and diversification of worksite members. It is necessary for worksite members to maximize results to maintain production.
Specifically, we take measures for employees who work until 65 after retirement at age 60 and female shop floor employees. In order to respond flexibly to new technologies and changes in production systems, we specify evaluation down to the elemental technology unit. Start-up seminars are also held to support transferred employees to support efficient acquirement of work skills.
 
TQM (Total Quality Management)

TQM is a management initiative that puts into practice the principles of “Customer First,” “kaizen (continuous improvement),” and “every member participating.” Its goal is to create a culture of employees challenging themselves to institute reforms and achieve human resource development that draws
out creativity. As measures to implement it, Toyota is actively carrying out QC circle activities* and the Creative Suggestion System. QC circle activities in particular have also been deployed to affiliates overseas, with more than 110,000 participants involved in approximately 14,000 circles every year.
* QC circle activities: The circles are formed mainly by employees in shop floor jobs, who actively engage in activities to identify and solve on-the-job problems. When carrying out activities, all circle members make a concerted effort to make continuous improvements, with a determination to promote individual growth and improve the workplace together. As a result, teamwork and trust are developed, and a positive and fulfilling workplace is created.


QC Circle Activity Promotion Structure
 


Human Resource Development of Overseas Employees at TMC Head Office

With the goal of promoting self-sufficiency in overseas affiliates, we temporarily transfer employees from overseas affiliates to TMC for OJT. Transferees focus on learning skills, knowhow and the Toyota Way throughout their training period, which is from six months to three years. Executives are posted as
general managers or department managers at TMC to learn about decision-making processes and to be connected with other employees.
As of June 2018, a total of 461 transferees from 49 affiliates in 28 countries are working in TMC.

Diversity and Inclusion

Fundamental Approach Diversity and inclusion is one of the key bases of management and Toyota is working to create an attractive workplace where employees with various skills and values can achieve self-realization.
Our new intranet site, Diversity Net was launched in June, 2018. It provides information to foster a diversified culture within the company. We believe that the new ideas created and the identification of new issues from these diverse perspectives will lead to even greater competitiveness.

Teleworking at Home Program (Japan)	Diversity Management (Japan)

 
Work style innovation is intended to raise productivity and support the balance between childcare or nursing care and work. In October 2016, the program for telework at home was expanded to Free Time & Location (FTL) Program. The former program covered only employees with children or those who are providing nursing care, but the FTL Program can be used by employees who wish to use it and meet certain requirements, by obtaining the consent of their supervisors.
As of the end of FY2018, approximately 13,200 employees were eligible, and a total of 3,300 employees were using the program. Employees are commenting that they are able to work more efficiently with better time management and that they can have more time with their family.
From April 2018, we have introduced a new program that enables partial teleworking at home* for
gyomushoku (staff level). We encourage work style innovations with every member involved.
* Only for childcare or nursing care
 
Managers promote diversity management to create workplaces where diversified members can perform their best. At Toyota, we call bosses who can carry out diversity management, Ikubosses. Toyota fosters supervisors who can manage with flexible minds, while keeping up the performance level and fulfilling their own and team members’ private lives.
Starting in FY2017, Ikuboss declarations by 1,100 managers have been posted on the intranet. Constant posting of activities or messages to subordinates fosters a culture of mutual support for diversified members.
In 2018, we have implemented Diversity Management Training for those who have been newly promoted to managers. In addition, we have implemented Emotional Barrier-free Training to deepen understanding about LGBT people and people in wheelchairs, targeting young employees.
Our aim is to provide diversity management in all workplaces.

Toyota Female Engineer Development Foundation (Japan)
Toyota and nine group companies established the Toyota Female Engineer Development Foundation in December 2014 to contribute to the promotion of women’s participation in manufacturing businesses in Japan. The aim is to attract and expand the number of girls to study in the science fields and foster
female engineers in monozukuri (manufacturing). For example, our female engineers visit schools in Aichi Prefecture and give lectures to high school students to introduce careers. The Foundation provides a development program for female engineering university students to support career-building as well as a scholarship program that provides financial support.

The work-life balance support pamphlet also has a page addressed to male employees who are new parents, and lays out the supports for them. In addition, the intranet also shows examples of male employees taking part in childcare and examples of Ikumen (men engaged in childcare). Roundtables are held in some workplaces. As a result, in FY2018, the number of male employees utilizing childcare leave (with an average of 2.5 months) was 45 people, increasing by about three times from what it was five years ago. In addition, about 95 percent of males took short-term leave (paid leave, special leave) when their wife gave birth. In this way, more and more men are taking part in childcare.






















Encouraging Men to Participate in Childcare (Japan)
We are actively promoting male employees to take part in childcare.
Starting in February 2017, hand-written messages from superiors, and a letter which includes an explanation on work-life balance support are handed out to celebrate childbirth. In FY2018, about 3,000 employees received them.

Major Initiatives of Nursing Care (Japan)
As nursing care environments are changing, TMC has been expanding company measures on nursing care since 2009 in order to reduce employee anxiety and burdens, and allow employees to devote themselves to work.
For example, we hold lectures by outside experts such as licensed social welfare workers and nursing care workers since 2009.
In FY2018, TMC held a total of six lectures, two each on three topics: understanding nursing care, preparing for nursing care, and balancing nursing care and work. The lectures were attended by a total of approximately 500 employees and their families.

Employment for Over-60s (Japan)


Following the introduction of the Internal Re-employment Program for Retired Professionals in 1991, an Optional Re-employment Application System was launched in 2001 to outplace applicants to external affiliates and other sites, providing a framework for helping over-60s to continue working.
Based on the revisions to the Law on Stabilization of Employment of Elderly Persons in 2006 and 2013, the support was revised to expand re-employment by taking surveys and interviews based on the needs of the employees.
In addition, starting from FY2017, the Advanced Skilled Partner System was set up for shop floor employees to encourage and motivate employees to retire at 65 years old by maintaining their job rank and salary.

Employment of Fixed-term Contract Employees (Japan)

When hiring fixed-term contract employees, appropriate hiring and contract renewals are conducted with maximum efforts focused on maintaining stable employment and improving their work capacity. With
the full-time staff appointment system, fixed-term contract employees who have worked for TMC for at least one year have the chance to take an examination for employment by recommendation from their workplace. This leads to increased motivation and vitality.
Fixed-term contract employees are also given the opportunity in their third year. It is necessary to maintain strong workplace in order to achieve sustainable growth, and to this end, TMC continues to hire fixed- term contract employees as full-time employees.


Employment of Persons with Disabilities (Japan)

We believe that persons with disabilities deserve the chance to become socially self-reliant and provide them with opportunities to work together with non-challenged individuals.
As of June 2018, the number of people with disabilities employed was 1,282 accounting for 2.25 percent of the entire workforce (including special-purpose subsidiaries) which is above the legal requirement of
2.2 percent. We are working towards a better workplace to retain employees, by holding sign language classes, assigning consultants, and rolling out best practices.
 
Creating an Environment Where the Disabled Can Work with Assurance
Toyota Loops Corporation began operation in April 2009 with 28 people with disabilities and received certification from the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare as a special-purpose subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation in October of that year.
Toyota Loops primarily handles work that is outsourced from Toyota such as internal printing, mail services and enclosing catalogues. It also performs tasks on such as issuing visitor and employee identification cards, issuing asset number labels, and shredding documents as well as erasing data from PCs, and providing nursing assistance at Toyota Memorial Hospital.
In April 2016, the Hanamoto Office started full operation. In Nagoya and Tokyo offices, shipping specified correspondence using light goods vehicles started. In these ways, we are working to create new businesses to expand employment of the disabled.
As of April 1, 2018, Toyota Loops employed 244 persons with disabilities. The number of support staff has also been increased in order to eliminate or reduce anxieties that employees may have regarding their health or work. We are also reinforcing support by creating a consultation hotline and providing consultations with an industrial physician and counseling by a clinical psychologist and psychiatrist.
We actively exchange information with governmental bodies, local communities, and social welfare organizations to create working environments where each employee can work with reassurance.
We also have many employees who are active outside work. Six Toyota Loops employees participated in the Abilympics (a national technical skills competition for persons with disabilities) in Tochigi Prefecture held in December 2017, winning gold in the Office Assistant division and silver in the Database division.
In addition, employees have won gold in the Women’s 400 m Relay and bronze in the 200 m Relay at the international swimming meet held in autumn 2017 in Mexico by the International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability.

Localization of Management at Overseas Facilities

Toyota is localizing management at overseas affiliates from a medium- to long-term perspective. The roles are defined so that the head office determines what needs to be done, and overseas affiliates decide how they will carry out those tasks.
In principle, executives and chief officers responsible for overseas operations live at the respective overseas locations and create management systems close to operation.
Toyota also actively hires local employees. Of six regional headquarters, three are currently headed by non-Japanese chief officers. As of June 2018, TMC has seven non-Japanese executives (one of whom is an outside director).
We are working towards the localization of management posts as well. This should facilitate the timely understanding of customer and employee needs in each region, enabling us to make appropriate business decisions.

LGBT (Sexual Minorities)

 
Toyota has launched initiatives with the aim of creating workplaces with an appropriate understanding and acceptance of LGBT people (sexual minorities). Prohibition on discrimination or harassment of LGBT people has been incorporated into the employee behavioral guidelines, and we no longer require new graduates to fill in their sex on their employment application sheets.
In our company training, we provide training to enlighten new graduate employees about human rights, and we also provide experience-based training by outside instructors (LGBT people) for mid-career employees. For new management-level employees, we have diversity management training to help them deepen their understanding. Furthermore, Toyota has established an internal and external harassment consultation hotline and is making dedicated toilets for LGBT people in Head Office and Nagoya office. We will continue activities towards the appropriate understanding and acceptance of LGBT people.

Creating Attractive Workplaces

Fundamental Approach In order to strengthen its human resource base for sustainable growth, Toyota has a working environment in which employees can work with confidence and feel safe. Toyota strives to foster
employees’ pride and loyalty to the company by encouraging a culture of teamwork through communication.


 
WE LOVE TOYOTA Activity (Japan)
In order to deepen loyalty to the company, We Love Toyota has been carried out since FY2010. As a part of these activities, WE LOVE TOYOTA seminars were held in June and September 2017.
Approximately 400 employees attended, including executives. Teamwork was deepened by forming teams consisting of members who met for the first time and shared the joy of driving in Prius Cup (a race in which participants compete on fuel efficiency after driving a predetermined distance within a specified time) and other games.
Employees on 567 teams, including 12 from overseas affiliates, competed in the 71st Toyota Relay Race (HURE! hure! Ekiden) held in December 2017. Runners and members cheering strengthened the bond between the participants and staff. More than 34,000 people participated and their cheering enhanced the unity within Toyota.
 
provide excitement in the workplace. There are currently 35 sports clubs. Members work and train hard and as a result, have achieved high rankings at competitions.
In addition, Toyota carried out more than 200 programs in 2017, including sending Toyota athletes to lead “Dream Classes” at elementary schools in Toyota City, and providing support for sports classes offered by dealers and sports events held by local communities.

Stakeholder Engagement

Fundamental Approach In the preamble of its CSR Policy, Toyota declares that it will engage in stakeholder-oriented management in order to contribute to sustainable development and strive to maintain and
develop sound relationships with stakeholders through open and fair communications. Specifically, Toyota’s relevant divisions and offices all over the world act as the main contacts to hold dialogues with major stakeholders. They communicate Toyota’s philosophy and also help deepen mutual understanding. Additionally, Toyota maintains communication with external experts in order to examine, for example, the direction of its sustainability-related initiatives. Toyota will continue to further strengthen dialogue with stakeholders to earnestly address society’s expectations and to utilize them in our future initiatives.

Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050―Going Beyond Zero Environmental Impact and Achieving a Net Positive Impact

We have formulated the Toyota Earth Charter based on the Guiding Principles at Toyota, considering environmental issues as a paramount importance, and have established its promotion structure to address such issues. In the course of perceiving public opinions or world trends and while considering our focus in the years to come, Toyota is working on this problem with new ideas and technologies ahead of future challenges. In October 2015, we formulated six challenges based on piles of environmental issues and we have been moving ahead, aiming to establish a future society in harmony with nature.

Six Environmental Challenges to Be Achieved by Toyota Toward 2050	Processes to Identify and Implement the Key Challenges (Materiality)

 
In the “estimation of greenhouse gas concentrations and rising temperatures by 2100” scenario from the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC Working Group, there are several scenarios in which the atmosphere temperature in 2100 rises will be suppressed by less than 2°C over pre-industrial levels, but in any case, it is estimated that:
•	Greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 will be reduced 40–70 percent over 2010
•	Greenhouse gases will be almost zero or minus by 2100
Toyota has promoted a wide range of initiatives to address increasingly severe global environmental issues, such as extreme weather phenomena attributed to greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity depletion due to development, and water shortages caused by population growth. In October 2015, we announced the “Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050,” and we have been striving to reduce the environmental burden
attributed to automobiles to as close to zero as possible, while developing measures to contribute a positive impact on the Earth and its societies with the aim of achieving a sustainable society.
Serious Environmental Issues of the Earth and Society

 
 
Environmental challenges may involve both business risks and opportunities. It is therefore essential to identify key challenges (materiality) from both risk and opportunity perspectives when formulating a long-term vision. In order to grasp the potential risks and business opportunities, Toyota has collected
information, analyzing and identifying environmental challenges from the standpoints of their importance for both stakeholders and our business.

Collect and Analyze Information
We examined a wide range of global trends in collecting and analyzing information. These include scientific predictions for the environment in 2050, global frameworks and policy trends, development in emerging countries, major index from external rating agencies, and world leaders’ remarks on environmental issues at G7 Summits. This broad examination provided us with an understanding of macroeconomic trends and important needs of societies, leading us to grasp potential risks and opportunities.
Identify Environmental Challenges (Materiality)
We identified environmental challenges (materiality) through analysis of both the external and internal environments. Our analysis of the external environment is derived from ESG investor and research organization surveys and major indices, along with communication with stakeholders including international organizations, NGOs, and consumers, while the internal analysis is based on the Guiding Principles at Toyota, the Toyota Earth Charter, and discussions among internal concerned divisions.
Identify Key Challenges (Materiality)
We identified the key environmental challenges (materiality) by considering two aspects, which are the influence on stakeholders, and impacts on our potential business risks and opportunities. This helped us prioritize the importance of key challenges.



Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 Formulation, Regular Review, and Information Disclosure High priority challenges for both stakeholders and Toyota were formulated in the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 (Six Challenges) and approved by the Corporate Planning Meeting (current “Sustainability Meeting”), which decides our medium- to long-term strategies. Steady implementation of our challenges requires management’s recognition of environmental activities as potential business opportunities and effective investments, in addition to involving Group companies to strengthen collaboration with our
business partners. We will review and evaluate our action plans on a regular basis.

2030 Milestone Set in Order to Achieve the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050

In December 2017, Toyota announced its challenge toward the popularization of electrified vehicles for the decade from 2020 to 2030 as a pillar in the development and expansion of electrified vehicles, which is one of the medium- to long-term initiatives to realize the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050. The 2030 Milestone indicates how the six challenges will be as of 2030, including the details of this announcement. These activities are being further proceeded along with the Toyota Environmental Action Plan that sets the specific action plans and targets for every five-year period in order to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society.

 
2030 Milestone Set

Toyota has been proactive in the development and marketing of electrified vehicles by introducing the iconic Prius in 1997, and by working to make it widely adopted for the following 20 years. Cumulative electrified vehicle sales as of April 2018 have reached 12 million units, which has reduced CO2 emissions by 94 million tons. As the CO2 emissions volume of Tokyo in 2015 was 60.84 million tons of CO21, the effect of reducing CO2 emissions contributed by the widespread adoption of electrified vehicles is incredibly large.
For that reason, by achieving the 2030 milestone of “annual total electrified vehicle sales of 5.5 million units, including sales of 1 million or more battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs),” we estimate that CO2 emissions will be reduced by 35 percent over 20102.
 
On the other hand, even though the environmental burden during the operation of electrified vehicles is low, CO2 emissions during the production stage are greater than those of a gasoline vehicle of the same class. For that reason, it is necessary to set quantitative milestones for the production stage. In addition to reducing CO2 emissions in every stage of the vehicle lifecycle (production of materials, parts production/vehicle assembly, operation, maintenance and disposal), the 2030 Milestone sets quantitative and qualitative milestones for other challenges, including the establishment of a recycling-based society and living in harmony with nature, which will accelerate further reduction of the environmental burden and accomplish a net positive impact.

Climate-related Scenario Analysis	Results of Verification in Two Senarios

 
In order to realize the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, the 2030 Milestone was established based on the current situation of Toyota and social trends. In the setting of the Milestone, based on “different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario,” the influence that climate change will have on Toyota was analyzed and resilience of Toyota's medium- to long-term strategy was verified. The climate scenarios mentioned above referred to those equivalent to “2°C” and “Beyond 2°C” in the International Energy Agency (IEA) report, and electrified vehicle sales and production activities at plants were analyzed.

On the other hand, although the ZEV* ratio surpasses that in “2°C,” it does not reach the level of “Beyond 2°C.” However, through the development of HEVs, Toyota has been establishing a mass production base by cultivating the component technologies essential to electrified vehicles. These technologies will also be applicable to ZEV, and Toyota is capable of making flexible and strategic changes to the powertrains and line-ups according to changes in demand. As we look toward “Beyond 2°C,” we will make flexible decisions on the necessity to change the line-ups by monitoring various indicators to grasp global trends.

Carbon pricing policies have been in discussion globally toward the achievement of the 2°C target. In terms of the financial risk from this policy, there may be a cost increase due to the carbon price according to CO2 emissions from energy usage emission. However, Toyota has been globally promoting CO2 emissions reduction at plants in the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 and 2030 Milestone. On this basis, we expect to reduce costs from carbon pricing and energy purchase costs by energy-saving and energy creation.
Therefore, measures for the 2030 Milestone can lower the financial impact due to carbon pricing.

Risks and Opportunity Recognition in Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050

When it comes to making management decisions Toyota recognizes the various risks arising from global environmental problems and then conduct activities against them toward the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, taking it as an opportunity for Toyota to enhance its sustainable competitiveness.
Of the risks attributed to climate change, the risk of disasters due to abnormal weather not only affects business continuity but also threatens the lives of people around the world and hinders sustainable development. Regulatory risks such as fuel consumption regulations and energy-saving regulations may also lead to increased costs for vehicle and production activities and lost sales opportunities due to a delay in responding to regulations.
Toyota considers it is possible to create more sales opportunities by promptly responding to regulatory risks, as well as contributing to the world sustainable development through undertaking the zero challenges of Challenges 1 to 3, which will help mitigate the physical risks due to climate changes.
As for water resources, although the details and extent of risks are
different in each region of operation, if water is used in excess or if polluted water is discharged, there will be a huge impact on the regional water environment, and operations may not be permitted. With regard to the use of resources, there is a risk that production will be delayed due to resource depletion, and the risk of the need to impose an unnecessary duty for processing on manufacturers due to the inappropriate treatment of End-of-life vehicles in each country and region.
Risks from the loss of biodiversity also includes the risk of impacting
the surrounding ecosystem due to inappropriate development and operation, as well as the risk of damaging sustainable development due to the loss of the affluent natural environment on a global scale. By means of Challenges 4 to 6, Toyota is not only minimizing these risks and impacts but also making a positive contribution in each region, which we recognize leads to trust being gained from each region and further raises business sustainability and sales opportunities.

Review Commentary
Three years ago, when I learned Toyota set a target of reducing the environmental burden attributed to automobiles to as close to zero as possible under the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, I was confident that the level of corporate sustainability strategy in Japanese industries would steadily be advanced. Toyota overturned our common practice of discussing the future based on past accomplishments and setting goals based on the outlook for fulfilment, and I felt that this was an advanced concept of setting what the future should look like and positioning it as a starting point for considering what needs to be done. Nonetheless, there could still be a gap in employees’ understanding between goals for 30 to 40 years ahead in the future, and targets in the
 
Toyota environmental action plan covering a five-year span. This 2030 Milestone now set will serve as an effective means of linking the present with the future and gaining the understanding of stakeholders.
On the other hand, looking at the results and progress regarding the six challenges and action plans, there are some things that I would like to point out. First, it still needs a lot of work to grasp current conditions and manage progress at overseas sites. Considering the status of Toyota’s global business development, it will not be possible to achieve the targets through the efforts of TMC alone. Second, there is room for collaboration among the different Challenge items. For example, by transforming the biotechnology and afforestation business into a forestry management business, a path to contributing to achievement of Challenge 2 may be possible. Third, additional priority should be placed on promoting eco-driving.
Connected technology will make it possible at some point to assess the level of eco-driving by all drivers. Fourth is to actively commit to the use of clean energy. Companies that adopt RE100 are increasing in Japan and overseas. I understand well the difficulties of connecting the future with the present, but I expect that Toyota will continue to report periodically on its progress as a leading Japanese company.










continued support of all our stakeholders.

Challenge 1	New Vehicle Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge

Fundamental Approach Extreme weather phenomena around the world are wreaking havoc on society, attesting to the reality of global warming. If adequate measures are not taken, the harm will become even
more severe, and the risks of global-scale damage have been pointed out. It has been reported* that if further efforts are not made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and current conditions remain unchanged, average global temperatures could rise by 3.7 to 4.8°C by 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels and that in order to keep the temperature increase to less than 2°C, reducing CO2 emissions to zero will not be enough—we must reduce emissions to less than zero. Amid global efforts to hold the temperature rise less than 2°C, Toyota sees this situation as both a risk and an opportunity and announced the “New Vehicle Zero CO2 Challenge.” Toyota will strive to slash average CO2 emissions per vehicle by 90 percent in comparison with 2010 levels, by 2050.
Based on the idea that eco-friendly vehicles contribute to society only when they come into widespread use, we are not only deploying technologies for conventional engine vehicles, but also accelerating advances in technology and its widespread adoption for the electrified vehicles that Toyota has been developing (including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs)). Toyota is committed to continue working hand in hand with stakeholders to build the necessary infrastructure that supports the widespread adoption of these vehicles.
* 5th Assessment Report of IPCC Working Group III (2014)












 

Promoting Development of Next-generation Vehicles Using Electric Power, and Widespread Use According to Their Features

Eco-friendly Vehicles Contribute to the Environment Only When They Come into Widespread Use Toyota has undertaken serious measures to address global environmental issues including global warming, air pollution, and resource and energy problems. In order to solve these social issues, we believe that effective vehicle electrification is essential for the efficient use of energy, and encouraging the use of alternative fuels. Based on the belief that eco-friendly vehicles can contribute to the environment only when they come into widespread use, Toyota has taken the initiative in developing and promoting the use of electrified vehicles. In 1997, we launched the Prius, a predecessor to electrified vehicles, and over the following 20 years, we have improved the performance of the Toyota Hybrid System (THS) and expanded the models on which it is used, developed electrified vehicles based on hybrid technologies, and supported the widespread adoption of these technologies.
 

In December 2017, we announced the “challenge to promote widespread use of electrified vehicles” covering the period from 2020 to 2030 and are working to encourage broader adoption.

Challenge to Promote Widespread Use of Electrified Vehicles
We aim to achieve global sales of at least 5.5 million electrified vehicles including at least 1 million zero- emission BEVs and FCEVs by 2030. We will expand dedicated electrified models and electric options through about 2025 and will have no vehicles available only as an engine model globally.
Starting in 2020, we will accelerate the introduction of BEVs, initially in China, and will expand BEV models to at least 10 in the first half of the decade worldwide. We will also expand the lineup of FCEVs and PHEVs throughout the 2020s. With regard to HEVs, we will raise the efficiency of the THS II while developing various types of hybrid systems such as high-power and simplified versions, expanding the product line-up to meet customer needs.

Toyota is committed to reducing the global average CO2 emissions from new vehicles more than 22 percent by 2020 from the 2010 level to steadily proceed with our challenge. As specific initiatives, we will further improve the environmental performance of electrified vehicles and expand their use in line with developing and deploying powertrains with high environmental performance, based on our next- generation platform strategy known as TNGA*.
In August 2017, Toyota launched the new Camry, which boasts vastly improved fuel efficiency performance, in Japan. We are expanding hybrid systems, including the October 2017 launch of the JPN TAXI equipped with the newly-developed liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) hybrid system. Along with measures to improve the environmental performance of conventional engine vehicles, we are conducting steady development to achieve our 2020 targets.

Toyota Marks 20th Anniversary of Prius Launch

Since its launch in 1997 as the world’s first mass-produced hybrid passenger vehicle, the Prius has endeavored to carve open a new era. It celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2017. The Prius name, derived from the Latin for “to go before,” was adopted to embody the idea of a vehicle that will shape the future of the Earth. The Prius has gained the support of many customers who are in agreement with this concept. Based on the concept that eco-friendly vehicles can contribute to society only when they come into widespread use, the Prius and the electrified vehicles that have inherited environmental technologies will strive to contribute to the global environment with the support of its many users.


Looking Back on the Birth of the Prius	Inheriting Hybrid Technologies

 
The development of the first-generation Prius had a two-fold mission: build a car for the 21st century and transform the way Toyota makes cars. Among the many issues facing the automotive world at the time, we anchored our efforts on two themes—the environment and natural resources. We faced numerous hardships developing an unprecedented vehicle, but we announced the first-generation Prius in October 1997 under the banner “In time for the 21st century” in advance of COP3 (the third United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, where the Kyoto Protocol was adopted).
The Prius boasted fuel efficiency approximately double that of gasoline vehicles in the same class at the time and was a pioneering first step not just for the widespread adoption of Toyota hybrid electric vehicles, but also for the current global trend toward widespread use of electrified vehicles.
With each new generation, Toyota is enhancing environmental and driving performance and has increased the number of units sold.
 
The Toyota Hybrid System (THS) adopted on the first- generation Prius evolved into the second-generation THS II, and later, use was expanded to other models. Toyota positions hybrid technologies as core technologies and is developing a range of electrified vehicles including PHEVs, BEVs, and FCEVs.
Each type of electrified vehicles has its own characteristics and each alternative fuel also has unique strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, energy conditions and policies

Challenge 2	Life Cycle Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge

 
Fundamental Approach
 
To mitigate the various risks posed by climate change, the “Life Cycle Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge” seeks to completely eliminate CO2 emissions not only while driving vehicles, but
 
throughout the entire vehicle life cycle including materials and parts manufacturing and vehicle assembly, maintenance, disposal, and recycling.
Some electrified vehicles may have materials and parts that increase CO2 emissions in the processes of manufacturing. Possible means of reducing this include adopting low CO2 emitting materials during manufacturing as well as reducing material usage and the number of parts used. It is possible to reduce CO2 emissions in the disposal and recycling stages by expanding use of recycled materials and designs that make it easier to dismantle vehicles.
We will accelerate eco-friendly designs as we pursue “ever-better cars.”

Response to Scope 3
Scope 3 is a standard established to measure CO2 emissions at all stages of a company’s business activities and identify areas for future reductions. Scope 3 accounts for not only CO2 emissions from their activities and those of their consolidated subsidiaries (Scope 1 and Scope 2), but emissions from other stages of the life cycle, such as procured materials and parts, transportation, employee commuting and business travel, along with the driving, maintenance, and disposal of customer vehicles.
The calculation results for FY2018 are overall Scope 3 CO2 emissions of 412.01 million tons-CO2, with category 1 and category 11 combined accounting for the bulk of the total, approximately 97 percent. Category 1 covers emissions from materials and parts at the manufacturing stage, while category 11 covers emissions from vehicles driven by customers. Therefore, use of lightweight parts, materials selection, development of fuel efficiency improvement technologies, and next-generation eco-friendly vehicles are important measures that will lead to CO2 emissions reduction.
Moving forward, we will continue to monitor Scope 3 emissions and utilize the findings to take measures for developing technologies.
 
Pursuing Transportation Efficiency and Reducing CO2 Emissions in Logistics Activities

To reduce CO2 emissions in its logistics activities, Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) is taking measures to improve the transportation efficiency of production parts, completed vehicles, and spare parts.
In FY2018, we continued fuel efficiency initiatives, including loading efficiency improvement activities, shortening logistics routes, and so on, reducing CO2 emissions per unit of workload (transported volume) to 104.2 g-CO2/tkm (down 1.0 percent year on year). CO2 emissions from logistics operations totaled
0.286 million tons (up 1.4 percent year on year), due largely to an increase in completed vehicles shipments in Japan.
At the global level, Toyota began assessing CO2 emissions in each country and region in FY2008, and indicated global target guidelines starting in FY2014. Based on these guidelines, each country and region set a goal toward which they have been carrying out reduction activities. As a result, Toyota’s global CO2 emissions in FY2018 totaled 2.17 million tons. We will make a full analysis of results and continuously strive to further improve transportation efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions per transportation volume.

Challenge 3	Plant Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge

 
Fundamental Approach
 
The Plant Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge seeks zero CO2 emissions in the vehicle manufacturing process. To achieve this, Toyota is introducing innovative technologies, conducting daily
 
kaizen, introducing renewable energy, and utilizing hydrogen. First of all, processes and the time required were reduced by simplifying and streamlining manufacturing processes, which made an improvement to energy use efficiency, including equipment optimization and the use of waste heat. Furthermore, we use every possible means to reduce CO2 emissions including introducing an innovative process called karakuri that does not consume any energy source at all.
In addition, we will effectively utilize renewable energies such as solar power and wind power along with hydrogen energy.















 
Reduce CO2 Emissions in Production Activities

Introduction of Innovative Technologies and Daily Kaizen
In our production activities, we have been developing and introducing low-CO2 production technologies along with taking daily improvement measures to achieve our reduction targets.
In FY2018, Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) plant manufacturing divisions worked with production engineering and drive force personnel to conduct energy diagnoses at production sites, propose improvements, implement measures, and undertake energy-saving activities (internal ESCO activities). In addition, TMC continuously undertook yokoten* of best practices. Yokoten places particular emphasis on adoption of steamless and airless processes and shifting to LED lighting, thereby increasing examples that can be expanded from common processes to multiple processes and sharing information on best practices to accelerate daily kaizen. As a result, we reduced total CO2 emissions to 1.14 million tons (down 1.4 percent year on year), and CO2 emissions per unit produced to 0.394 tons (down 1.1 percent year on year).
 
Globally, measures for the development of overseas human resources as activity leaders were taken and genchi genbutsu training was conducted to make internal ESCO activities more autonomous and accelerate them. Kaizen was also achieved by increasing TMC best-practice (from 29 examples to 62 examples) and expanding it to subsidiaries in Japan and to overseas plants.
Affiliated companies in Japan actively implemented internal ESCO activities, but some companies had higher energy consumption as a result of increased aluminum wheel production in conjunction with efforts to make vehicles lighter. Also, CO2 emissions reduction effects were achieved through the purchase of renewable energy and installation of solar panels and in-house power generation for internal consumption. As a result of these measures, total CO2 emissions were 7.79 million tons (down 0.2 percent year on year), and CO2 emissions per unit produced were 0.740 tons (down 0.2 percent year on year).
In order to reduce CO2 emissions from production activities, we will strive to accelerate our energy saving activities, carrying out internal ESCO activities and other activities.

Introducing Renewable Energy and Utilizing Hydrogen
Toyota is promoting the introduction of renewable energy, taking into consideration the characteristics of each country and region. When introducing renewable energy, we place the highest priority on in-house generating facilities (such as solar power generation) and in-house consumption at Toyota plants and other facilities.
In FY2018, we generated 17,578 MWh of renewable energy globally (see pp. 100–102 for information on hydrogen use).

Toward Realizing a Decarbonized Society in 2050: Effective Use of Renewable Energy
These days, one means of decarbonization that holds particular promise is renewable energy. Toyota is working to reduce CO2 through comprehensive energy-saving measures by deploying innovative technologies and daily kaizen. However, it is not feasible to reduce the amount of energy used to zero only by introducing these energy-saving activities in manufacturing. To decarbonize the remaining energy, it is necessary to introduce renewable energy and use hydrogen.
The use of renewable energy is an issue that needs to be addressed by all of society, and accordingly, we are collaborating with many parties including the national and local governments as well as local communities and other businesses.

Three     Perspectives     on     the     Effective     Use     of     Renewable     Energy The effective use of renewable energy requires comprehensive investigation from the perspectives of environmental, regional, and economic factors. First, we introduce in-house power generation (such as solar power generation) at our own plants and other facilities. Then we consider external purchases. Already, TDB, our affiliate in Brazil, has introduced energy sourced from hydropower generation, and we will proceed with implementation in stages starting with high-suitability areas, taking into regional and environmental characteristics into consideration.
Toyota will strive to introduce systems and mechanisms that will lead to the widespread use of renewable energy. Our objective is to achieve zero CO2 emissions at plants all over the world by 2050.
 


Renewable Energy Covers All Electric Power at North American Headquarters Campus Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (TMNA), which marked 60 years of business in the United States, constructed a new headquarters campus in Plano, Texas. The designs feature exterior walls made predominantly from glass to maximize use of natural lighting. Also, southern exposures have generous roof overhangs to control sunlight to appropriate levels. Moreover, the buildings and parking facility have more than 20,000 solar panels installed, providing more than 30 percent of the electric power used in the
buildings. Electricity is also purchased from wind power generated in Texas, and as a result, renewable energy covers all electric power usage. These efforts were recognized by the
U.S. Green Building Council, and the facility

Water problems such as increases in water stress in conjunction with rising populations and stricter regulations in response to deterioration of water quality in rivers and other water sources are important issues from the perspective of risks in corporate activities.
Water is used in painting and other car manufacturing processes. This makes it imperative to reduce the impact on the water environment, to whatever degree possible.
There are significant differences in the characteristics of the water environment depending on the region, but we have two main strategies: thoroughly reduce the amount of water used and comprehensively purify water and return it to the environment. Toyota has implemented various initiatives such as collecting rainwater to reduce industrial water usage, cutting water usage in production processes, recycling wastewater to reduce amounts withdrawn from water sources, and returning high-quality water to local environments.
In the future, we will undertake measures that have a positive impact on local water environments, taking into consideration the local requests and water issues.

Measures Undertaken in Accordance with the Toyota Water Environment Policy

Although water-related issues and measures differ depending on the region, Toyota established the Toyota Water Environment Policy and takes action in order to achieve the goals of our water environment Challenge on a global level.
Under the Toyota Water Environment Policy, we are assessing our impact on water environments and working to minimize those impacts from two perspectives: the input side, where we are taking thorough measures to reduce water usage, and the output side, where we are taking comprehensive measures to purify water.
We take action from three directions—the pursuit of environmental technologies, community-rooted operations,

Reduce Water Usage in Production Activities
 
Trends in Global Total Water Usage and Usage per Unit Produced
 

 
To reduce water usage in our production activities, we have been working to introduce innovative technologies alongside planned upgrades to our production lines, and to conduct daily measures to reduce water usage.
In FY2018, Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) took measures in painting pretreatment processes, which use large amounts of water, such as implementing recycling of water discharge in chemical coating processes and optimizing washing nozzles in electrodeposition coating processes to raise the efficiency of use within processes. As a result, total water usage was 10.3 million m3 (down 3.2 percent year on year). Water usage per unit produced was 4.0 m3 (down 7.6 percent year on year).
Globally, Toyota is steadily implementing measures to reduce water usage according to the actual water environment in each country and region. However total water usage rose to 32.9 million m3 (up 0.4 percent year on year) because of increased washing in pretreatment processing due to quality measures implemented in conjunction with model redesigns and process changes. Water usage per unit produced was 3.1 m3, up 1.2 percent year on year.
Moving ahead, we will continue striving to minimize impacts on the water environment through the promotion of water-saving and water recycling.

Toyota’s Water Environment Challenge: Connecting with Society

 
Thoroughly Reduce the Amount of Water Usage (Policy 1)

Evaluate Impact on the Water Environment Through Dialogue with Local Affiliates Based on evaluations of the impact of water usage volume on the water environment, we set four plants (see p. 106) in three regions as challenge-focused plants and are taking action. Some regions have few water resources but in fact water is stably supplied, and therefore, the impact evaluation and local understanding were not in agreement in those regions. Discussions regarding these regions had been conducted over the course of six months, taking into consideration issues that have arisen and potential future impacts from climate change and other factors of concern.
In addition, we collected more detailed regional water-related information and continuously updated impact evaluations to reach mutual understandings. This led to enhanced awareness of our efforts to reduce water usage and invigorate activities.
 
■	Case study 2: Reducing water usage by eliminating water cooling towers (Turkey) At TMMT, an affiliate in Turkey, kaizen activities are reducing water usage.
Until now, the temperature of the water circulated in order to cool the compressor that makes compressed air was cooled by means of a cooling tower. However, it was necessary to supply approximately 50 m3 in additional water each day to cooling towers that evaporate water in order to lower the temperature.
Now, using low-temperature municipal water (15°C), we have introduced a new cooling system that lowers the temperature of circulated water through a heat exchanger.
This kaizen made it possible to discontinue the use of cooling towers and supply water became unnecessary, so water usage was reduced by 0.06 m3 per unit produced, and annual water usage is down 16,500 m3.

A. Reduction of substances of concern
Chemical coating is performed as a vehicle body undercoat treatment. Until now, Toyota has developed technologies such as chemical coating agents compatible with bodies containing aluminum and steel as well as a nickel- and phosphorous-free treatment agent that reduces environmental impact.
By switching to processes that do not include materials that place a burden on the environment such as nickel, the impact on water quality has been reduced. It was first introduced in 2013 in conjunction with the retooling of production lines and was introduced in 2017 at the Tahara Plant, which produces the Land Cruiser and the Lexus LS, GS, and IS.

In addition, to ensure that there are no contaminants with pollutants due to accidents and so on in rainwater, which is normally clean and does not go through a water discharge treatment facility, water quality, analysis is periodically performed.

D.	Prevention of leaks
We take measures to prevent leaks of contaminated water from plant sites even in the event of an accident including (1) creating ditches at plant entrances to prevent leaks, (2) installing pipes above ground so they can be examined for leaks, and (3) building dikes around oil and chemical tanks.

Challenge 5	Challenge of Establishing a Recycling-based Society and Systems

Fundamental Approach  Due to global population increase along with the pressure for economic growth and convenient lifestyles, the pace of resource consumption is accelerating. If large-scale exploitation
continues as it is, natural resources will be depleted, and if waste increases due to mass consumption, appropriate disposal will be unable to keep pace, resulting in risks of environmental pollution. To prevent the environmental impact caused by End-of-life vehicles, Toyota launched the Toyota Global 100 Dismantlers Project, to establish social systems for End-of-life vehicle proper treatment. In order to realize an ideal resource- recycling based society, it is necessary to grasp the risks of resource depletion and the possibility of creating business opportunities, and initiatives are needed in four key areas: (1) use eco-friendly materials, (2) use auto parts longer, (3) develop recycling technologies, and (4) manufacture vehicles from End-of-life vehicles. Toyota aims to realize the ultimate recycling-based society, and promotes the Toyota Global Car-to-Car Recycle Project (TCCR) so that we can use resources from End-of-life vehicles for manufacturing new vehicles.
 

 
Reduce Consumption of Dwindling Natural Resources Through Use of Renewable Resources and Recycled Materials

Reduce the Use of Petroleum-derived Plastics
Since the early 1990s, Toyota has been collecting and recycling bumpers replaced at dealers as a way to reduce the usage of petroleum-derived plastics. Some plastic parts collected from End-of-life vehicles were reused for energy as a heat source except using for used parts. Others were recycled into plastics for non-automobile use after going through a machine-automated sorting process.
In FY2018, we teamed up with dismantling companies to continue implementation of trial tests for collecting End-of-life vehicles-derived plastics, investigated the efficient removal of foreign substances, and undertook measures to create recycled materials that can be utilized in vehicles.
Amid the growing need to further promote plastic recycling, we will continue to study new technologies for collecting and recycling plastics from End-of-life vehicles to support sustainable economic growth globally.
 
Promote      the      Reuse      of      Rare      Resources      and      Recycled      Materials Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles, and other electrified vehicles use significant amounts of rare resources compared with conventional gasoline vehicles. Some of these resources often carry risks such as resource depletion or uneven supply among regions. In order to promote the reuse of resources and the adoption of recycled materials, we are collaborating with partner companies to establish a framework for collecting and recycling HEV batteries and automobile motor parts, along with cemented carbide tools used in production.
HEV batteries, for example, contain rare metals such as nickel and cobalt. Since launching the first- generation Prius in 1997, we have built our own recovery network to collect End-of-life HEV batteries for recycling and reuse. As of March 2018, we collected 98,700 End-of-life HEV batteries in total.
The collected batteries undergo inspection to determine which parts can be remanufactured into stationary storage batteries or vehicle replacement batteries. Parts not suitable for reuse are recycled as raw metal materials.

Toyota began recycling automobile motor magnets in 2012. As of March 2018, we collected a cumulative 35 tons of magnets, recycling rare earth.
For cemented carbide tools, we launched a system to extract and recycle tungsten1 in 2010. As of March 2018, we recycled a cumulative total of approximately 170 tons of cemented carbide tools. The use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) is expected to increase in the future to support the design of light-weight vehicles. We have made progress toward effective thermal recovery2 for this material, and development of technologies for material recycling of waste CFRP is ongoing.
As electrified vehicles become further widespread, the amount of End-of-life parts, such as batteries and motors that contain rare resources, is expected to rise. We will continue material recycling activities for End-of-life parts and CFRP.
1	Tungsten: Japan imports all of its demand for tungsten, which is used in the cutting edges of 80% of cemented carbide tools
2	Thermal recovery: During the incineration of waste, thermal energy generated is recovered and reused
 

Toyota Develops Neodymium-reduced, Heat-resistant Magnet for Use in Motors, Can Reduce Neodymium Use up to 50 Percent
The magnets used in automobile motors and other components are powerful magnets that contain approximately 30 percent neodymium, a rare-earth element. The powerful neodymium magnets used in automotive and other applications must have high coercivity even at high temperatures. As a result, in addition to neodymium, which is produced in relatively high volumes, rare-metal elements like terbium (Tb) or dysprosium (Dy) are also added.
Rare earth elements range from the plentiful and inexpensive to the scarce, but the rare earth elements used to enable magnets to be employed at high temperatures are expensive rare metals with high geopolitical risks. To address this, considerable efforts have been made to develop magnets that do not use these metals and positive results have been achieved. In contrast to this, production volumes of neodymium are relatively high, so there have been few such initiatives, but there are concerns that the supply and demand balance may break down as electrified vehicles become increasingly popular in the future.
The newly-developed magnets do not use scarce rare metals and replace a portion of the neodymium with

low-cost and abundant rare earth elements, thereby reducing the amount of neodymium used in the magnet. In addition, new technology that can suppress the deterioration of coercivity and heat resistance was developed so that there is no loss of performance in motors at high temperatures as a result of the replacement of the neodymium. The same heat resistant performance as earlier neodymium magnets is achieved, while reducing the amount of neodymium used by up to 50 percent.
This new type of magnet is expected to be useful in expanding use of motors in various areas such as automobiles and robotics, as well as maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of valuable rare earth resources. Development of elemental technologies for motors, inverters, batteries, and other components will require steady research and development in anticipation of the future. Toyota positions these technologies as essential for electrified vehicles and will continue making steady progress in each and every area, while working to build the foundation that will support the increased use of electrified vehicles in the future.

Achieve Industry-leading Levels in Easy-to-dismantle Design for Effective Resource Recycling

To promote material recycling of End-of-life vehicles, Toyota directly visits dismantling companies in Japan and overseas to investigate actual conditions and gain insight into the development of vehicle structure that make it easy to dismantle and separate parts. We have actively adopted these designs for new models since 2003 with the launch of the Raum passenger car.
The new Camry, JPN TAXI and Lexus LS unveiled in FY2018 adopt the Toyota New Global Architecture
 
(TNGA)1, a new concept for car manufacturing which ensures superior stability and control along with a comfortable ride with minimal vibration and sway. These vehicles continue to incorporate easy-to- dismantle designs to ensure safe and speedy dismantling operations.
In other areas where we adopt new structures, parts, and other technologies, we will continue to ensure easy-to-dismantle designs in order to maintain and enhance the capability to dismantle vehicles.

Contribute Worldwide Through Appropriate End-of-life Vehicle Treatment and Recycling Technology Developed in Japan

When End-of-life vehicles are not properly disposed or dismantled, this may not only affect regional environments, but also cause risks to the health and safety of local residents. To prevent these problems, we promote the Toyota Global 100 Dismantlers Project. Through this project, we aim to establish social systems for properly treating of End-of-life vehicles without imposing regional environmental impact. Our long-established End-of-life vehicle dismantling technologies and know-how contribute to the establishment of social systems.
In FY2018, we prepared a manual on proper dismantling of End-of-life vehicles and a video manual on
airbags deployment for countries and regions that lack suitable dismantling facilities. Responses to the regulation on proper End-of-life vehicle recycling in Vietnam were completed, and a model facility for proper End-of-life vehicle dismantling was established in Thailand.
We have been constantly researching the flow of End-of-life vehicles and setting an each target level according to the conditions of regional infrastructure in cooperation with local affiliates.
We will strive to establish recycling-based societies with proper treatment of waste oil, fluids, CFC/HFC gas and efficient resource recycling by expanding the Toyota Global 100 Dismantlers Project gradually.

Expand Original Recycling Systems for End-of-life Vehicles Worldwide

In order to realize an ultimate recycling-based society, we promote the Toyota Car-to-Car Recycle Project (TCCR) that is based on the concepts of reduce, reuse, and recycle, aiming specifically at elimination of resource-related risks and global warming.
In FY2018, we conducted trials with a model in Japan as a blueprint toward the establishment of a global recycling-based society. We are identifying issues for the creation of optimal social systems in 2030.
Batteries for HEVs are expected to increase overseas in the future, and in FY2018, we started initiatives to globalize battery recycling systems, establishing collection and recycling schemes in each region.
The ultimate goal of this project is closed-loop recycling, the concept that the vehicles parts and materials are recycled into identical parts. We will continue promoting “Car-to-Car Recycling” through gradual progress in both aspects of this system, namely the first phase of resource recycling in which vehicle parts and materials are turned into raw materials for new parts, and the second phase of fully reusing recycled materials in new vehicles.

Reduce Packaging and Wrapping Materials and Use Resources Efficiently in Logistics Activities

Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) is taking a broad range of initiatives to reduce the amount of packaging and wrapping materials used in logistics. These include increasing packaging efficiency in shipping containers, using returnable containers* to reduce the amount of unrecyclable materials used, and making packaging and wrapping materials simplified and lighter.
In FY2018, TMC succeeded in reducing the amount of packaging and wrapping material per shipment unit to 6.21 kg/m3 (down 9.6 percent year on year) by making packaging and wrapping materials smaller and adopting returnable shipping containers. The total volume of packaging and wrapping materials used amounted to 45.8 thousand tons (down 10.9 percent year on year).
Also, on a global basis, Toyota continued efforts to gather and share information on best practices at
each affiliate.
Moving forward, we will promote the efficient use of resources when shipping goods, while striving to reduce the volume of packaging and wrapping materials.

Challenge 6	Challenge of Establishing a Future Society in Harmony with Nature

Fundamental Approach It is critical for humans to conserve forests and other natural environments in all regions for coexistence in harmony with nature. However, deforestation is progressing across the world,
resulting in the fragmentation of habitats of diverse species, as well as the continuing loss of biodiversity. This entails a number of issues including the loss of biological resources that are essential for society, causing natural disasters, and spurring global warming, and we believe that it poses a risk to the potential for the sustainability of society as a whole including Toyota. In light of this risk, Toyota launched three “connecting” projects and is taking action to expand activities various regions of Japan and overseas in order to “enrich the lives of communities” in each region. We will expand these activities at group, regional, and organizational levels using the insights we have gathered so far, aiming for a future where people and nature live in harmony.

Promote Expansion of Nature Conservation Activities Connecting Communities
—Toyota Green Wave Project

Toyota Group companies have conducted afforestation activities at their respective plants and undertaken environmental conservation activities in their surrounding areas. The Toyota Green Wave Project is an initiative to connect regions through these diverse activities promoting harmony with nature. By extending Toyota Group activities to promote harmony with nature in Japan and overseas, we aim to expand natural habitats and help create a sustainable society, benefitting biodiversity.
Specific programs include the Plant in Harmony with Nature Project, which creates environments that foster nature and living creatures, and the All-Toyota Green Wave Project, which fosters ties between local communities and the Group.

Evolution from “Afforestation Activities at Plants” to “Plant in Harmony with Nature” Afforestation activities have been conducted since 2007 with the theme of creation of forests at plant sites. The Tsutsumi Plant, where the Prius is produced, serves as a model plant for this project.
 
A recalculation of results from the past 10 years indicated that approximately 2 million trees have been planted in Japan and overseas, creating sites that foster nature and living creatures.
We expanded activities in FY2018, and in the future will carry out the Plant in Harmony with Nature Project. These activities are not limited to forest environments covering forests at plants, but are being expanded to cover the habitats of various living creatures. In addition, species that serve as indicators (indicator species) are selected to quantitatively assess ecosystems and are continuously monitored. The Plant in Harmony with Nature Project is being carried out by not only employees but also employees working under the guidance of local experts and in collaboration with local residents. Specific actions include periodically surveying indicator species according to the level in the ecosystem pyramid and reviews of activities based on the survey results. Continuation of these activities contributes to the preservation of regional biodiversity.
We expect that these activities will build and develop positive relationship between the plants and local ecosystems and promote good communications among employees and interaction with local communities.

Boost Grant for Environmental Activities Connecting with the World
—Toyota Today for Tomorrow Project

Toyota has conducted cooperative activities in Japan and overseas with environmental NGOs including the Toyota Environmental Activities Grant Program and afforestation programs in China and the Philippines. We have established Toyota Today for Tomorrow Project to bolster our long-standing grant program on a global basis. With the aim of contributing to society, we will work together with organizations engaged in nature conservation around the world by establishing projects to solve issues in the areas of living in harmony with nature and biodiversity.

Launch   a   Five-year    Partnership    with    WWF    on    Living    Asian    Forest    Project In July 2016, Toyota entered into a five-year partnership with WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) aiming at accelerating the globe’s transition to sustainability. Toyota is the first car company and the first Japanese company to sign a Global Corporate Partnership agreement with WWF.
To promote biodiversity conservation under the partnership, Toyota has made annual 1 million US dollar grants to WWF since 2016 to support the Living Asian Forest Project. The Living Asian Forest Project aims to strengthen existing WWF activities to conserve tropical forests and wildlife in Southeast Asia and launch new conservation initiatives.

Toyota Collaborates with IUCN to Enhance Data on Biodiversity Preservation Status
Toyota began a five-year partnership with International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)1 in May 2016 to raise awareness of the biodiversity crisis. Under the partnership, we provide annual grants of approximately 1.2 million dollars and began supporting the IUCN to enrich the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™ (the IUCN Red List)2. With this support, the IUCN will conduct assessments of more than 28,000 species at risk of extinction, accounting for 35 percent of species requiring assessment. This represents a major step forward in the IUCN’s goal of gaining a comprehensive view of the conservation status of biodiversity on the Earth.

Boost Contributions to Environmental Education Connecting to the Future
—Toyota ESD Project

Human resources development is crucial for expanding environmental conservation activities to the future. Consequently, the Toyota Education for Sustainable Development Project promotes sustainable human resource development suited to local communities. Our corporate training approach is to nurture environmentally conscious employees and leverage their awareness to make it better for business.
Additionally, we are connecting our training activities to the future by making the best use of the features of business sites and company-owned fields to provide environmental education for children, who will be responsible for sustainable societies in the future.

Toyota Shirakawa-Go Eco-Institute
Toyota Shirakawa-Go Eco-Institute, located at the Shirakawa-Go world heritage site, opened in 2005 with the goal of widely promoting locally rooted environmental education valuing nature’s inherent wisdom. The concept of “living in harmony” is central to the Institute, which is located in rich nature at the foot of Hakusan (Mt. Haku), and which provides many adults and children visiting Shirakawa-Go with hands-on nature programs as well as working on ecosystem surveys of wildlife, along with forest conservation activities. In 2015, to commemorate the institute’s 10th anniversary, we enhanced the hands-on nature programs under the slogan, “Trail walking for adults. Forest play helps kids grow stronger.” The Institute aims to provide opportunities and education to enable individuals to understand and take action on their own initiative through shared education that enhances growing and learning together toward living in harmony with nature. There is a special emphasis on “children’s camp” that nurtures children’s environmental awareness, self-reliance, and ability to take action.
In FY2017, the Old-Growth Forest Insect Survey Camp and Hakusan Outdoor Journey camp programs for
junior high school students were added. A total of eight camp programs were conducted, drawing 353 participants. The total number of people staying
overnight at Shirakawa-Go in FY2018 was 16,718, and 13,046 people participated in institute programs during the year. Since opening in 2005, the institute has welcomed more than 209,000 visitors.
Toyota Shirakawa-Go Eco-Institute will continue to develop new hands-on nature programs to nurture
an awareness of living in harmony with nature
 
Forest of Toyota
Forest of Toyota in Toyota City is a company-owned forest near the urban areas. It has been maintained based on the environment of satoyama, which was once part of our lives, creating a forest where living creatures can naturally inhabit.
Since 1997, the forest has been open to the public. Anyone can walk freely through the forest and take part in various events to experience the satoyama environment and learn about nature through their five senses. In 2017, we celebrated 20 years since the forest opened to the public. Since 2001, we have also provided hands-on learning events for regional elementary schoolchildren. In 2017, these events were attended by 5,538 children.

■	FY2018       Activities:       Nationwide       Dragonfly       Park       Project In June 2017, we held the “Future of Harmony between People and Nature as Learned from Dragonflies” event, the second in a series held to learn about the ecology of living creatures of satoyama. Dragonflies are familiar creatures that make use of the waterside environments that people create in their lives. By learning about dragonfly ecology and habitats, we considered the importance of biodiversity and human living in harmony with nature. An expert discussed the causes of decreases in dragonfly populations. They presented research results such as new findings on the ecology of dragonflies and efforts to expand paddies   using   reduced   agricultural    chemicals    to    preserve    dragonflies. During a field tour to the Forest of Toyota, participants observed dragonfly nymphs living in the soil, the smallest dragonfly in Japan. Information was also presented on methods of developing water environments  that  are  employed  on a daily basis in the Forest of Toyota. Finally, the participants discussed methods of environmental preservation that they can undertake. One participant commented, “I hope to create biotopes that take living creatures into consideration and conduct environmental education for children that conveys the interesting ecology of dragonflies.”
We will continue to conduct environmental education programs that use dragonflies as inspiration to learn about nature in our immediate surroundings and lead to action.
 
among a growing number of adults and children.

Promoting Environmental Contributions Through Biotechnology and Afforestation Business, Automotive Peripheral Technologies, and Forest Conservation Activities

Cooperation with Preservation of Peat Swamp Forests in Indonesia
Indonesia is the third largest emitter of CO2 in the world when forest fires, peat fires, and other factors are included. Emissions from peat as a result of peat fires and other causes account for 37 percent of the total, equal to more than half of the total CO2 emissions in Japan. On the other hand, preserved peat swamp forests are not only carbon sinks, but are an important habitat for species at risk of extinction including the orangutan and proboscis monkey. In order to preserve swamp forests and prevent CO2 release, in addition to fire prevention and monitoring activities, we are carrying out activities to prevent the depletion of forest resources by supporting the economic independence of local residents in the Katingan region of central Kalimantan.
As part of the support activities, Toyota has brought in an improved fast-growing Napier grass in rural villages where beef cattle are raised and began on-site cultivation tests in 2016. The tests verified that the Napier grass produces yields that are more than double those of the varieties grown locally. We also confirmed that not only can the tips of the Napier grass be used as forage grass, but the lower portion of the stems can be used as a source of fuel as an alternative fuel and as biogas. Utilization of this developed variety of Napier grass is expected to support economic independence by local residents and lead to preservation of peat swamp forests.
In the future, we will confirm the effectiveness of selected developed varieties and cooperate with local companies to verify effectiveness on a practical scale such as expanding self-sustaining models to other rural villages.

We are also conducting programs to learn about forestry and the deep relationship between the forest and human beings fully using the nature properties of Miyagawa region which has the history of timber industry.
In FY2018, we started a new project, the Forest Challenge and Development, aiming for connecting forests with future generations. Taking on a challenge for utilization of trees and spaces as well as lumber production, business plans were collected widely from the public. Also, three participants selected through a screening implemented forest-based programs starting in April 2018. To raise awareness of some wisdom from forests and trees as well as promote the use of wood, we planned workshops to produce sculpted furniture and day-to-day goods made of wood with good designs.
We are also planning events that will enable more people to enjoy maintained mountain forests.
We will continue to invigorate local communities and forests by increasing the number of people involved with forests.

Initiatives at the New Toyota R&D Center Promoting Harmony with Nature and Local Communities
Toyota is constructing a new research and development facility in the overlapping area of Toyota City and Okazaki City. This new facility will be a hub for development of sustainable next-generation mobility. The main design concept is a technical center in harmony with nature and local communities. About 60 percent of the total project site will be preserved as areas for the regeneration of forests and management of yatsuda rice paddies (paddies in low-lying areas) in collaboration with the local community. Toyota is also actively sharing information including the status of these activities and findings gained from them.
 
■	FY2018 Activities (2):
Rice paddy living creatures survey team
In July 2017, we conducted a survey of the living creatures in rice paddies. We used landing nets and plastic bottle traps to capture living creatures in three kinds of waterside areas with different environmental conditions: rice paddies (with agricultural chemical use), biotope (without agricultural chemical use), and waterways. We examined the species and numbers living in each environment and compared the differences. Participants learned from explanation by an expert that there is a relationship between the living creatures living in rice paddies and surrounding forests, and when living creatures decrease due to changes in the environment, food chains collapse, and ultimately there is an impact on human food supplies.

■	FY2018 Activities (1): Acorn tree planting activity at business site
In June 2017, Toyota held a tree plating activity with the participation of 90 prefectural and municipal personnel and others local concerned persons including fifth and sixth grade students and teachers from the Hanayama, Tomoegaoka, and Onuma Elementary Schools in Toyota City and the Shimoyama Elementary School in Okazaki City. The saplings, grown at elementary schools in milk packs, were raised from konara oak and Japanese blue oak acorns collected on the business site. On the day of the event, a total of 600 saplings were planted. By growing saplings from collected acorns and returning them to the mountain, we are preserving acorn mountain. The Karen Forest Development Promotion Association, a member organization of the Shimoyama Satoyama Conference, plays a central role in this program, and Toyota employees participate as volunteers each year. We will continue to support local proactive activities that lead to the preservation of Satoyama and will take measures to make the new R&D facility a sustainable technical center in harmony with nature and local communities.
 

Bamboo  charcoal  making  and  searching  for  spring  living  creatures  in  satoyama In March 2018, we conducted a program on making charcoal from bamboo and searching for spring living creatures in satoyama. The objective was to inform participants about earlier lifestyles in satoyama, which used natural resources cyclically, and raise awareness about current satoyama issues. Members of the Nukata Charcoal Making Group, a member organization of the Shimoyama Satoyama Conference, demonstrated bamboo charcoal making techniques using pail can and discussed uses for charcoal in daily life. Participants learned about damage caused by animals and one of the solutions is to hunt and eat. They tasted a lunch of wild boar stew prepared by local mothers. During the search for living creatures, participants learned about the various environments of satoyama and the many creatures inhabiting them by finding signs of living creatures in forests and grasslands, and observing egg masses of montane brown frogs in rice paddies.

Environmental Management

Fundamental Approach Toyota’s environmental philosophy and policies are based on the Guiding Principles at Toyota established in 1992 (revised in 1997). Policies for environmental initiatives were formulated in
1992 as the Toyota Earth Charter (revised in 2000). This Charter is shared among 671 Toyota affiliates* subject to the Consolidated Environmental Management System (consolidated EMS) around the world. The Toyota Global Vision announced in 2011 emphasizes the importance of “Respect for the Planet.” Based on its philosophy and policies, Toyota formulated the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 in FY2016 as its first long-term vision for environmental initiatives. In FY2017, Toyota launched the Sixth Toyota Environmental Action Plan (FY2017–2021). Under this structure of environmental management system, Toyota is identifying environmental risks and opportunities that can affect business operations and is working for sustainable development in harmony with society toward the year 2050.
* Since FY2017, in addition to the subsidiaries based on the formal standards, those based on the effective control standards have also been added due to the amendment of the Japanese Companies Act

Legal Compliance Activities
Toyota aims to ensure that its production activities pose zero environmental risk to local communities. The foundation of our efforts is preventive measures to avoid non-compliance issues and complaints. Neglecting preventive measures can lead to situations where non-compliance may occur. We consider these situations to be non-compliance near-misses, and we take stringent measures to root out the causes of these near-misses and prevent reoccurrence.
For incidents posing significant risk, we share information on reoccurrence prevention measures through environmental affairs meetings at all Group companies. Additionally, we are taking measures to completely eliminate the use of ozone-depleting substances (ODS), and no significant releases have been found.
In FY2018, Toyota was not involved in any major environmental incidents causing air or water pollution, nor was the Group subject to fines or penalties. However, rainwater came in contact with cement during piling work on a building construction site at Honsha Plant, and alkaline runoff flowed through rainwater ditches into a river, causing environmental non-compliance. A report was immediately made to the
 
uniqueness, effectiveness, and potential for application at other sites, in particular, were selected by a vote of all attendees to receive special prizes.

Reduce VOC Emissions in Production Activities

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs*) are one of the causes of photochemical oxidation, the cause of photochemical smog. Toyota has been striving to reduce VOCs emitted in vehicle painting processes. Specifically, we have reduced the use of paints and thinners, continuously promoting initiatives linked to painting facility refurbishment plans and day-to-day activities to reduce VOC emissions.
For FY2018, as a result of continuous day-to-day activities to reduce VOC emissions, the volume of VOC emissions per area painted in TMC body painting processes (average for all lines) was 14.4 g/m2 (down
1.0 percent year on year). For TMC and its consolidated subsidiaries in Japan, VOC emissions volume was           21.5           g/m2           (up           0.2           percent           year           on           year). Also, the volume of VOC emissions per area painted in TMC bumper painting processes (average for all lines) was 176 g/m2 (down 8.8 percent year on year).
* VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds): Used in painting, adhesives, and other products, VOCs are volatile at room temperature under normal pressure. VOCs cause air pollution and soil contamination, raising concerns about the influence on the human body.

Promote Environmental Activities in Cooperation with Business Partners (Suppliers)

Toyota purchases a wide range of materials, parts, and equipment from many different suppliers. We have collaborated with suppliers on implementing environmental initiatives through TOYOTA Green Purchasing Guidelines1, seminars, and other means.
After announcing the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, we revised guidelines in January 2016, working with suppliers to maintain existing measures including compliance with the laws and regulations of each country and managing substances of concern and undertake a broad range of environmental initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG), assess water risks and reduce impact on water environments from those risks, encourage resource recycling, and protect ecosystems in support of the Challenge. We have been working even closer with suppliers to that end.
We request that our tier 1 suppliers to roll out environmental initiatives to their suppliers, and we seek to realize entire supply chain management in the pursuit of a sustainable society.
1 Green Purchasing Guidelines: Prioritizing the purchase of parts, materials, equipment, and services with a low environmental footprint when manufacturing products


Completed Revision of the Green Purchasing Guidelines Globally
Toyota conducts purchasing not only in Japan, but in regions around the world. Each affiliate has its own Green Purchasing Guidelines. After the revision of the TOYOTA Green Purchasing Guidelines in Japan (completed in January 2016), we completed revision of guidelines at overseas sites in FY2017 and requested that suppliers implement measures.

Mutual Study About the Environment
Each  year,  we  hold  a  forum  for  studying  environmental  issues  with  suppliers. In FY2018, a management roundtable conference on the environment was held in June with the participation of the management from many key suppliers. Toyota gave a briefing on the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 and renewed its request to suppliers for their cooperation and collaboration in carrying out the Challenge. There were also presentations by participating companies on examples of their own environmental initiatives, a question and answer session, and an exchange of opinions, deepening understanding of common issues.
 
Recognition          of          Suppliers’           Environmental           Initiatives           Started Toyota established the Environmental Activity Awards in FY2018 to commend suppliers who make company-wide efforts with major contributions to conduct environmental initiatives throughout the vehicle lifecycle and entire supply chain. The awards were presented at the Global Suppliers Conference, which also serves as a forum for Toyota to explain its action policies.

Assessing Risks and Opportunities Related to Climate Change and the Water Environment in Supply Chains
We introduced the CDP Supply Chain2 Program in FY2016 to support the continual implementation and improvement of environmental initiatives conducted with suppliers. The program enables us to assess environmental risks and opportunities across the supply chain.
We have been enhancing the program’s activities through briefings and other types of communication with suppliers.

Ensuring Compliance with REACH and Other Global Regulations on Chemical Substances In order to minimize severe negative impacts on human health and the environment due to the production and usage of chemical substances, nations are strengthening laws related to chemical substances, which include the Chemical Substances Control Law in Japan, and the ELV Directive3 and REACH regulation4 in Europe. To properly respond to these regulations, Toyota has built and is operating chemical substance management frameworks in cooperation with its suppliers.
We continued these efforts in FY2018 and asked suppliers in Japan to conduct self-assessments of their operations. We also worked with suppliers to take further measures. We also shared these efforts to main overseas sites.

Promote Environmental Activities in Cooperation with Business Partners (Dealers and Distributors)
 
will also be responsible for creating environmental guidelines of each overseas region based on global environmental guidelines for dealers and distributors, tracking the progress of their operation.
 
Toyota has strong bonds of trust with its dealers and distributors built on shared values for products and services, supporting a long history of collaborative initiatives in environmental activities.
Given their direct contact with customers, dealers are a critical partner in carrying out environmental initiatives. Therefore, we are fully implementing a Toyota dealer CSR checklist in Japan and taking measures to enhance environmental controls to reduce CO2 emissions. In overseas regions, we strongly promote environmental management through environmental activities led by regional headquarters and distributors along with continual DERAP implementation.

Promoting            Environmental            Initiatives            at            Domestic            Dealers The Toyota National Dealers’ Advisory Council (TNDAC) promotes unified efforts among all dealers in Japan to implement voluntary activities based on the Toyota Dealer CSR Guidelines set forth in 2005. To further promote environmental initiatives, TNDAC encourages dealers to attain third-party certification of their environmental management systems and accelerate the development of environmentally conscious dealerships and human resources, in which we aim to bolster customer trust in Toyota dealers.
In FY2018, we used the Toyota dealer CSR checklist to promote thorough environmental assessments at dealers while also encouraging the acquisition of Eco-Action 21 accreditation. As a result, five additional dealers attained Eco-Action 21 accreditation.
Moving forward, we will strive to improve environmental initiatives by working together with dealers to enhance environmental performance and planning Toyota’s new initiatives.

Raise                Ratio                of                Dealers                 Achieving                 DERAP Toyota continues the Dealer Environmental Risk Audit Program (DERAP) to reduce environmental risks at overseas dealer service shops. These audits aim to establish a framework to deal with five fundamental
 

Further Strengthen Global Employee Education and Awareness Activities

In accordance with the national policies of Japan, Toyota designated June as its “Toyota Environment Month” in 1973 and has been taking measures since then to raise employees’ awareness and actions for the environment. In 1991, we changed the name to “Toyota Global Environment Month,” and we are expanding activities globally.
We ensure that all global employees are aware of Toyota Global Environment Month by distributing the President’s message on the environment through global affiliates in their local languages and making event-related notifications on monitors at various locations throughout company sites and on the intranet.

Year-round                 Awareness                 Activities                 for                 Employees Starting in FY2018, we provided environmental information to employees, planning and carrying out a variety of programs throughout the year to enhance employees’ environmentally conscious mind and accelerate measures for achieving the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050. Toyota Global Environment Month is considered to be one part of these measures.
For each program, a cycle with three phases—know, learn, and act by taking voluntary action—are performed with regard to the environment, and options are available for each rank according to the level of employees’ awareness and environmental understanding. During the “know” phase, in order to raise employees’ awareness, digital signages installed at each company site disseminate environmental information, educational splash screens are displayed
when PCs are started up, and stickers encouraging energy saving by setting air conditioning temperatures appropriately in conference rooms and by closing the
 
environmental requirements, including the proper management of waste and treatment of water discharge. From FY2018, as new items, checking for and keeping records on the presence of oil on the surface of water in final separation tanks, and maintaining records through periodically washing all tanks were added, enhancing the quality of activities.
In FY2018, 92 distributors and 4,296 dealers from 89 countries worldwide participated in DERAP, representing an increase of nine distributors and 63 dealers from FY2017. The five requirements were satisfied by 4,086 dealers, 95 percent of all participating dealers (up 4 percent year on year). Globally, there are still many Toyota distributors and dealers which do not participate in the program. We will continue to support expansion of DERAP participation and promote the activities of the participating companies. We
 
lids of electronic bidets seats in rest rooms are placed. During the “learn” phase, we provide opportunities to learn throughout the year such as holding environmental lectures presented by outside instructors, conducting internal environmental seminars by the general manager of the Environmental Affairs Division, and reimbursing test fees for employees who pass the environmental specialist certification test (Eco Test).

In the “act” phase, Environmental Campaign of Creative Suggestion System was conducted as a main program of Toyota Global Environment Month, and a wide variety of environmental proposals were submitted. Company-wide, more than 25,000 suggestions were received, serving as an opportunity to raise awareness. In addition, inspirational posters that depict the gazes of animals were created as an approach that will spontaneously generate interest in order to raise employees’ awareness and understanding of eco- driving. Posters were displayed five times starting in June, which is Toyota Global Environment Month, in employee cafeterias, employee entrances and communication spaces, employee dormitories, company housing, and other locations. At the same time, we renewed the eco-driving introduction section on the website of the Environmental Affairs Division to provide fun and easy to understand explanations.
In November, which has been designated Eco-Driving Month by the Japanese government, a pamphlet

New Employee Training Program Raises Sense of Ownership
 
Enhance Active Disclosure of Environmental Information and Communication

Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) strives to proactively disclose environmental information and enhance its communication through an annual Environmental Report, its website, and events.
In February 2018, our Environmental Report 2017 won the Excellent Prize in the Environmental Reporting Category of the 21st Environmental Communication Awards sponsored by Ministry of the Environment of Japan and other organizations. Toyota was awarded for two consecutive years following the Excellence Prize in the Global Warming Countermeasure Reporting Category won by the Environmental Report 2016. On its website, TMC released seasons 2 and 3 of “econohito,” which is a web movie content featuring employees who strive to carry out environmental activities toward achieving the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050. At events, Toyota’s environmental initiatives were presented in easy to understand formats and workshops and other programs raised environmental awareness. Toyota will continue to enhance content even further, activating communications.
 
In FY2018, new employee training program was conducted three times in April. The current status and risk of and issues concerning Toyota’s environment undertakings were explained to 756 new administrative and engineering employees. The aim is to instill the knowledge necessary for carrying out work with the same high level of awareness of the environment as safety and quality.
In addition to conventional classroom instruction, time is spent on group discussions and presentations on topics such as “environmental risks that Toyota should prioritize” and “countermeasures and actions” to address risks so that the participants see the environment as a personal issue. Later, employees discuss their personal environmental dreams and hopes that they would like to achieve.
Participants commented that the training raised their sense of ownership regarding environmental issues

Corporate Governance

Fundamental Approach Toyota regards sustainable growth and the stable, long-term enhancement of corporate value as essential management priorities. Building positive relationships with all stakeholders,
including shareholders, customers, business partners, local communities and employees, and consistently providing products that satisfy customers are key to addressing these priorities. To this end, Toyota constantly seeks to enhance corporate governance. Moreover, Toyota complies with the general principles of the Corporate Governance Code promulgated in June 2015. The specifics of these efforts are discussed in Sustainability Meetings and reported to the Board of Directors.
In March 2011, Toyota announced the Toyota Global Vision, formulated in light of the operating environment at the time and the Guiding Principles at Toyota. Based on a commitment to being a company that customers will choose and will feel good about having chosen, the Toyota Global Vision clearly defines Toyota’s aspirations for the future.


Organization and Structure

■ Business Execution and Supervision
With the aim of achieving the Toyota Global Vision, Toyota has been implementing ongoing revisions in its operational framework in order to quickly respond to the unprecedentedly rapid changes occurring in the external environment. Toyota introduced regional entity operations in 2011, followed by the business unit system in 2013 and the in-house company system in 2016. Then, in 2017, to accelerate decision-making and operational execution, Toyota further clarified that the Members of the Board of Directors are responsible for decision-making and management oversight, and operating officers are responsible for operational execution.
Furthermore, in 2018, to accelerate management oversight that is fully coordinated with the workplace, Toyota moved up the timing for changing the executive lineup from April to January, revised the corporate strategy function, and restructured the Japan Sales Business Group based on regions rather than sales channels. These organizational changes are designed to transform the company structure into one that facilitates decision- making close to customers and close to where the action takes place.
Together with the business units (in-house companies and Business Planning & Operation Units), operating officers, mainly consisting of the president and executive vice presidents, to whom authority is delegated by the Board of Directors, will realize prompt decision-making and move forward with initiatives toward sustainable growth and medium- to long-term improvement of corporate value. As part of the management oversight of operations, the Sustainability Meetings deliberate the corporate governance structure that executes such initiatives.
Toyota has also established an International Advisory Board, comprising experts from around the world. The board provides advice on management issues from a global perspective as needed. Toyota also deliberates on and monitors management and corporate conduct from the diverse stakeholder perspectives in meetings, such as the Labor-Management Council/Joint Labor-Management Round Table Conference.

■ Board of Directors and Related Structures
Toyota’s Board of Directors consists of nine directors (of which three are outside directors). The structures related to the Board of Directors are based on comprehensive considerations with the aim of ensuring prompt, appropriate decision making and appointing the right person to the right position.
Toyota believes that it is crucial to appoint individuals who comprehend and are capable of putting into practice its core concepts of making ever-better cars and genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience). Moreover, these individuals must be able to contribute to decision making aimed at sustainable growth into the future. Toyota’s Executive Appointment Meeting, half the members of which are Outside Directors, makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding such appointments.
In order to ensure that outside perspectives are adequately reflected in management decision making, there are three Outside Directors, all of whom are registered as independent officers with the relevant financial instruments exchanges. When selecting Outside Directors who will serve as independent officers, Toyota considers the requirements set forth in the Companies Act and independence standards established by the relevant financial instruments exchanges. Toyota’s Outside Directors draw on their broad experience and insight, including their respective fields of expertise, to inform decision-making from a perspective independent from management structure.

■ Audit & Supervisory Board
Toyota has adopted an Audit & Supervisory Board system. Six Audit & Supervisory Board Members (including three outside members) play a key role in Toyota’s corporate governance by undertaking audits in line with the audit policies and plans. In appointing Audit & Supervisory Board Members, Toyota believes it is necessary to elect individuals who have broad experiences and insight in their respective fields of expertise and can advise management from a fair and neutral perspective, as well as audit the execution of business. Toyota’s Executive Appointment Meeting, half the members of which are Outside Directors, makes recommendations to the Audit & Supervisory Board regarding such appointments.
Three individuals, all of whom are registered as independent officers with the relevant financial instruments exchanges, have been appointed as Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members. When appointing Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, Toyota considers the requirements set forth in the Companies Act as well as the independence standards established by the relevant financial instruments exchanges.
 

■ Remuneration of Members of the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Basic remuneration and bonuses for Members of the Board of Directors are linked to corporate
performance while reflecting individual job responsibilities and performance. The amount and method of payment of remuneration are determined also considering the remuneration level in countries of origin. Bonuses are paid based on the relevant fiscal year’s consolidated operating income, comprehensively taking into account dividends, the levels of bonuses for employees, trends at other companies,
medium- to long-term business performance and past remuneration. Because the role of Outside Directors includes monitoring and supervising management from an independent standpoint, they are not paid bonuses.
Members of the Board of Directors receive remuneration and bonuses within the range of the total amounts determined in the Shareholders’ Meeting. The amounts are decided at a meeting of the Board of Directors with reference to proposals submitted by the Executive Remuneration Meeting, half the members of which are Outside Directors.
Remuneration for Audit & Supervisory Board Members consists only of fixed basic payments and does not include bonuses. As a result, this remuneration system is not readily impacted by business
performance, helping to ensure independence from management. Remuneration for Audit & Supervisory Board Members is determined by the Audit & Supervisory Board within the scope determined by resolution of the Shareholders’ Meeting.

■	Analysis and Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
After the Secretariat of the Board of Directors conducts a quantitative analysis of the state of performance pursuant to an instruction of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, a survey is conducted of Members of the Board of Directors (Members of the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members) regarding the state of execution of operations and of the supervision of such execution. Furthermore, interviews are held individually with Members of the Board of Directors, including the Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, based on results of the survey. The Secretariat of the Board of Directors Meeting combines and explains the findings to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and reports and discusses the findings at the Board of Directors.
For FY2018, it was confirmed, as a result of the evaluation, that effectiveness was secured. Based on meaningful comments provided regarding “acceleration of decision making,” “management oversight of operations” and other matters during the process of the evaluation, Toyota will continue to make improvements during FY2019 to further enhance effectiveness.

Fundamental Approach and Maintenance of Internal Control Systems

■	Basic Stance on System for Ensuring Appropriate Business Operations
TMC and its subsidiaries work to foster a sound corporate culture based on the Guiding Principles at Toyota and the Toyota Code of Conduct. Toyota integrates the principles of problem identification and kaizen (continuous improvement) into its operational processes and makes continuous efforts to train employees who will put these principles into practice.

■	System to Ensure Appropriate Operations
Toyota endeavors to maintain and properly operate a system for ensuring the appropriateness of business operations as a corporate group in accordance with its Basic Policies on Establishing Internal Controls. Each fiscal year, Toyota inspects the establishment and implementation of internal controls to confirm that the organizational units responsible for implementing internal controls are functioning autonomously and enhancing internal controls as necessary. The findings of these inspections are reviewed in the Sustainability Meetings and the Board of Directors Meetings.

For details on Fundamental Approach and Maintenance of Internal Control Systems, please see “IV. Basic Approach to Internal Control System and its Development” in the Corporate Governance Report.

Risk Management

Fundamental Approach  Toyota has been working to reinforce its risk management structure since the recall issues in 2010. In June 2010, Toyota established the Risk Management Committee (now Sustainability
Meeting and ESG Committee) and appointed risk managers globally and at each section to comprehensively prevent and mitigate the impact of risks that could arise in business activities.



 
Organization and Structure
Toyota has appointed a Global Chief Risk Officer (CRO) as a head of global risk management, who oversees significant risks and takes leadership to respond to significant global emergencies. Beneath the Global CRO are Regional CROs appointed to manage its own risk management structure.
Within the head office (such as Accounting and Purchasing), risk management is assigned to chief officers and their sections, while in each in-house company, risk management is assigned to the company president and their company. They coordinate and cooperate with the regional head offices and with each section.
To oversee and mitigate global risks, risks in business are identified and significant emerging risks are reported and reviewed by the ESG Committee.
In addition, as a business supervisory body, results from the ESG Committee are reported in Sustainability Meetings.
To respond to emerging risks in recent years, Toyota advances measures related to information security and business continuity management (BCM).
Risks related to Toyota’s businesses that could significantly impact the decisions of investors are listed in Form 20-F: Industry and Business Risks; Financial Market and Economic Risks; Regulatory, Legal, Political and Other Risks.

Initiatives for Information Security

With cyber attacks becoming more sophisticated and complicated, the targets of cyber attack are not limited to confidential information and information systems, but also include the networks of systems that control plant facilities and vehicles (such as on-board device systems). The importance of information security is increasing for Toyota.
Toyota will ensure the safety and security of our customers from cyber attack threats. Toyota considers it our social responsibility to protect our customers’ personal information and therefore is reinforcing information security by governance and risk management.
In June 2016, TMC and its consolidated subsidiaries together established Information Security Policy to clarify the information security basic policy and initiatives.
 

Organization and Structure
Under the Chief Information Security Officer, security officers are respectively assigned in the individual security fields to promote activities.
Details of activities in each security field and overall common issues are shared and discussed at Information Security Management Meetings to improve information security throughout Toyota.

Initiatives for Information Management
Toyota has established the All Toyota Security Guidelines (ATSG) covering TMC, its subsidiaries and affiliates seeking to
comprehensively prevent information leaks and emerging risks of cyber attacks.
ATSG ensures information security through a multi-faced approach: through organization, human resources, technical security, physical security, and incident/accident response. To cope with recent environmental changes and sophisticated cyber attacks, ATSG is revised periodically (latest update in April 2018).
By annually inspecting the information security initiatives being taken at each company in line with the ATSG, Toyota is working to ensure continuous maintenance and improvement. Furthermore, in FY2019, TMC will begin checking its subsidiaries (genchi genbutsu) for further improvements.

For personal information, individual education ensures that employees are well aware of the importance of following the law and handling information appropriately. We have responded to the Amended Act on the Protection of Personal Information (Japan) and the GDPR1 (Europe), and will continue to endeavor to protect personal information.
As for automobile-related matters, in Japan and the United States, Toyota has joined the Auto-ISAC2, an industry-wide community for auto makers to share information on cyber attack case examples. Toyota is making efforts to improve cyber security by monitoring the latest trends.

Business Continuity Management at Toyota

Although Toyota was not directly affected by large-scale disasters such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Thailand floods, our production operations stopped for a long period of time which caused inconvenience to customers both in sales and services.
There are deep concerns about the Nankai Trough Massive Earthquake occurring, as the Toyota Group Companies’ main functions are concentrated in the area. It is predicted that a large scale earthquake would severely impact our production and logistics operations.
To be prepared for such disasters, the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) was established to facilitate early recovery of business operations with limited resources.
In order to contribute to enriching lives of communities, Toyota will work on disaster recovery according to the Basic Guidelines. This guideline was followed in the Kumamoto Earthquake (April 2016).
 

Toyota’s Basic Guidelines (Priorities during a Disaster)




Business Continuity Management at Toyota
The PDCA3 is implemented and continuous improvement is undertaken through training, etc., to constantly raise the practical effectiveness of Toyota’s BCP.
These activities are identified as the Business Continuity Management (BCM), which are delivered through coordination among employees and their families, Toyota Group companies and suppliers, and Toyota.
Through this process of formulation and review of the BCP, we aim to develop risk-resilient organization, workplaces, and individuals. 3 PDCA: The circular process of Plan-Do-Check-Action for continuous
improvement

Humanitarian Aid and Early Recovery of Disaster-affected Areas (Communities)
Toyota has concluded comprehensive disaster support
agreements with local governments (Toyota City, Miyoshi City, Tahara City, and Susono City). In accordance with the Basic Guidelines, these efforts will give priority to disaster recovery and contribute to building disaster-resilient communities. Humanitarian support and regional recovery assistance are to be provided under mutual cooperation with local governments. Toyota is preparing relevant structures by incorporating necessary provisions in its business continuity plan (BCP) and conducting joint training with the local governments.
Details of the major support items are described below. Other support items agreed with individual local governments include provision of designated shelter facilities.
 

Building a Disaster-resilient Supply Chain with Suppliers
Toyota has provided recovery support in accordance with the following priorities: (1) Humanitarian aid; (2) Early recovery of the affected area;
(3) Restoration of Toyota’s operations and production. Since the Great East Japan Earthquake, we have worked with suppliers in each country and region to build a disaster-resilient supply chain by sharing supply chain information and setting up measures for prompt initial action and early recovery.
In sharing supply chain information in Japan, Toyota receives highly confidential information from suppliers and build up a database, RESCUE (REinforce Supply Chain Under Emergency) system, based on the concept of protecting Japanese monozukuri (manufacturing). Under strict protection of suppliers’ confidential information, Toyota conducts regular training with suppliers to utilize the system in case of a disaster. It was also utilized in the Kumamoto Earthquake in April 2016, Northern Osaka Earthquake (May 2018), and heavy rain disaster in western Japan (June 2018).
This system has been standardized and shared with other companies through the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, helping thus to build a disaster-resilient supply chain.
Toyota is implementing equivalent initiatives with suppliers in each country and region overseas.

Compliance

Fundamental Approach The Guiding Principles at Toyota state that Toyota shall “honor the language and spirit of the law of every nation and undertake open and fair business activities to be a good corporate
citizen of the world.” Toyota believes that adhering to this principle is to fulfill corporate social responsibility and ensure compliance. In accordance with its basic internal control policies, Toyota promotes creating a framework to adopt and enforce the code of conduct as well as other means of human resource development including training. Toyota has also established consultation hotlines; any concerns that are reported are carefully responded to ensure that no potential problem is missed.
The Toyota Code of Conduct (adopted in 1998 and revised in March 2006) outlines the basic frame of mind that all members of Toyota should adopt. It shows concrete guidelines for the Guiding Principles at Toyota to carry out social responsibilities. A booklet containing the Toyota Code of Conduct is distributed to all employees to put the code into practice at work and in the community.

 	Toyota Code of Conduct	https://www.toyota-global.com/company/vision_philosophy/toyota_code_of_conduct.html 

 
Organization and Structure
Toyota holds Sustainability Meetings to discuss expectations from our stakeholders and our responses to various social issues as well as corporate governance and compliance.

Checks to Enhance Compliance
In FY2009, Toyota began implementing internal checks to enhance its compliance structure. In FY2010 these checks were extended to subsidiaries in and outside Japan. Since then, these checks have been carried out and improved every year.
Results are reported to Sustainability Meeting and used as a basis for further improvement. By incorporating improvement points into each year’s action plans, we ensure that these checks lead to continuous improvement.
We also have discussions with subsidiaries to understand their compliance efforts and provide support when needed.

Ensuring Compliance
To ensure that awareness of compliance extends throughout the company, Toyota conducts training programs for directors, managers and newly recruited employees together with company-wide
e-learning programs.
In addition to standard legal areas including labor law, antimonopoly law and subcontracting law, we conduct seminars on bribery prevention, personal information protection, product liability law, and other topics. Around 1,000 employees attended these seminars in FY2018.
The Legal Division also conducts seminars at individual divisions on a wide range of topics based on their specific needs.
 
The Compliance Hotline
Toyota has established hotlines for quick and appropriate responses to concerns, complaints, or questions that employees may have.
The Compliance Hotline allows employees to have consultations concerning compliance-related issues and is run by an outside law firm (subcontractor). Upon request, the content of consultations may
be made anonymously. The consultations are passed to the responsible division and the details are investigated carefully to ensure that the employee who made the consultation is not identified. If the results of the investigation indicate an issue, a response is immediately implemented. For cases where we confirmed that there actually was an issue, we confirmed the facts and took appropriate measures in accordance with company regulations such as Work Regulations.
 

 









Corruption Prevention Measures
In response to the global expansion of our business and social demands, Toyota adopted the Anti- bribery Guidelines in 2012 to eliminate corruption. Toyota is strengthening its preventive measures and working to prevent corruption by raising awareness through internal training and by informing business partners as well.
Furthermore, Toyota has been incorporating bribery prevention into self inspection check sheets since 2013 and has been promoting improvement including in our subsidiaries.
