   Fundamental Approach	
 
Guiding Principles at Toyota
 

 
Toyota strives to be a good corporate citizen trusted by all stakeholders and to contribute to creating an affluent society through all its business operations. The corporate principles are explained as follows, with our basic values and mindset.

Five Main Principles of Toyoda



Relationship with Philosophy, Hoshin (Yearly plan) and Regular Business Activities
 
Since its foundation to the present day, Toyota has handed down the Five Main Principles of Toyoda released in October 1935, which embody the thinking of the Toyota Group founder, Sakichi Toyoda, and are the basis of corporate management.
In 1992, in response to changes in society and business structure, Toyota established the Guiding Principles at Toyota (revised in April 1997) to clarify how Toyota is expected to act, based on the recognition that strong policies are important for finding the way to proceed, especially when the environment surrounding us is drastically changing.

Guiding Principles at Toyota
 

 
   

Corporate Principles

Sustainability Policy




Toyota Way 2001	Toyota Global Vision

 
The Toyota Way 2001, defined in April 2001, clarifies the values and business methods that all employees should embrace in order to carry out the Guiding Principles at Toyota.
The Toyota Way is supported by two main pillars: “Continuous Improvement” and “Respect for People.” Continuous Improvement means that we are never satisfied with where we are and always work to improve our business by putting forward new ideas and working to the best of our abilities.
Respect for People means that we respect all Toyota stakeholders and believe the success of our business is created by individual effort.

 
We form a long-term vision, meeting challenges with courage and creativity to realize our dreams
 
The Toyota Global Vision—announced in March 2011—reflects lessons learned from financial losses caused by the global economic crisis in 2008 and the series of recall issues of 2010. It reflects company-wide review and comprehensive discussions on how Toyota wants to be, and the kind of values it should esteem.
The Five Main Principles of Toyoda, the Guiding Principles at Toyota, and the Toyota Way 2001 are fundamental values of Toyota’s corporate activities.
To be sustainable in society, we strive to implement a positive cycle of making ever-better cars that exceed customer expectations; contributing to Enriching lives of Communities by being rewarded with the smile of customers and communities; and achieving a stable business base.
 

 

We improve our business operations continuously, always driving for innovation and evolution



We practice genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience)―go to the source to find the facts to make correct decisions, build consensus and achieve goals at our best speed
 
Continuous Improvement



Respect	 	 for People
 

We stimulate personal and professional growth, share the opportunities of development and maximize individual and team performance



Toyota Code of Conduct

The Toyota Code of Conduct organizes the basic attitudes necessary for people working at the company and in society, providing a description of basic conducts. It also details what is required of employees and what needs to be kept in mind. Along with the Toyota Way 2001, it is essential that each employee carries out the Guiding Principles at Toyota and fulfills their social responsibilities.

Organization for Solving Sustainability Issues
 

Initiatives Aligned with Global Society
 

Stakeholder-oriented Management
 

 
As the automotive industry faces once-in-a-century dramatic changes, it is a requirement to make ever quicker decisions and be ever more efficient with work. Meanwhile, stakeholder levels of expectation regarding non-financial issues, centered on the Environment (E), Society (S), and Governance (G), are also increasing.
To respond to these changes, Toyota established its Sustainability Meeting in 2018. Chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, members include outside directors and outside auditors. The Meeting discusses
non-financial issues from a range of angles, and confirms management directions.

Organization
 
Toyota is working on initiatives that contribute to the sustainable development of society and the world through all its business activities in cooperation with global society. At the root of these initiatives are the Five Main Principles of Toyoda, passed down as the basis of our corporate management, and the Guiding Principles, which lay out how we are expected to be as a company. In 2011, we announced the Toyota Global Vision, which lays out how we want to be as a company, based on our experiences with the 2008 global financial crisis and the series of recalls we had in 2010.
Toyota's ideas and values are in line with the aims of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which went into effect in January 2016.
In addition, environmental issues are one of the key aspects of what Toyota sees as sustainability issues. With a view to the “under 2˚C” scenario* agreed on in the Paris Agreement, we are promoting initiatives under the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050.
*	At the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Paris in 2015, efforts to reduce net emissions of CO2, etc. to zero in the second half of this century were agreed upon with a long-term goal of keeping the rise in the global average temperature to well below 2°C compared to the preindustrial revolution level.

  Contribution toward achieving SDGs through the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 (p. 51)
 
In the preamble of its CSR Policy, Toyota declares that it will engage in stakeholder-oriented management in order to contribute to sustainable development and strive to maintain and develop sound relationships with stakeholders through open and fair communications.
Specifically, Toyota’s relevant divisions and offices all over the world act as the main contacts to hold dialogues with major stakeholders. They communicate Toyota’s philosophy and also help deepen mutual understanding.
Additionally, Toyota maintains communication with external experts in order to examine, for example, the direction of its sustainability- related initiatives.
Toyota will continue to further strengthen dialogue with stakeholders to earnestly address society’s expectations and to utilize them in our future initiatives.

Initiatives for Improving Traffic Safety


 

   Fundamental Approach	

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) survey*, 1.35 million people worldwide died in traffic accidents. While the number of deaths due to traffic accidents has been decreasing slightly in Japan, the United States and Europe, it has been constantly increasing in emerging nations and regions where traffic safety education and transportation infrastructure have not kept up with increases in the number of cars on the road. Unless countermeasures are implemented, traffic fatalities are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of accidental death by 2030.
In order to achieve Toyota’s ultimate goal of Zero Casualties from Traffic Accidents, the development of safe vehicles is of course important, but it is also essential to educate people, namely drivers and pedestrians,

and to ensure safe traffic infrastructure including traffic signals and roads.
Toward achieving a safe mobility society, Toyota believes it is important to promote an Integrated Three Part Initiative, involving people, vehicles, and the traffic environment, as well as to pursue Real-world Safety by learning from actual accidents and incorporating that knowledge into vehicle development. Toyota has also defined its Integrated Safety Management Concept as the basic philosophy behind technologies toward achieving the elimination of traffic casualties and is moving forward with developing such technologies.

Integrated Safety Management Concept
Toyota provides optimum driver support for each stage of driving, from parking to normal operation, the accident itself, the pre-and post-crash timeframe, and post-accident rescue. Toyota’s approach is to enhance safety levels through strengthening inter-system coordination rather than seeing each system separately. These are the approaches behind our Integrated Safety Management Concept.

Actual Status of Traffic Accidents and Toyota’s Safety Technology
There were 3,532 traffic fatalities in Japan in 2018, a drop of 162 people over the previous year. This was the lowest number since the National Police Agency began keeping records in 1948. Classified by road users, pedestrians accounted for the largest number of deaths, with the percentage of fatalities among the elderly (65 years or older) increasing yearly.
Another emerging issue is accidents caused by drivers pressing the accelerator by mistake instead of the brake in parking lots, or driving the wrong way down expressways, which are both more common among the elderly. This is becoming a major social issue.
For this reason, more and more attention is being given to active safety technologies that help prevent accidents in addition to the existing passive safety features. At Toyota, we are working on installing the Toyota Safety Sense system that packages multiple active safety systems, including collision damage mitigation braking, in almost all our passenger vehicle models. We are also working on developing the Intelligent Clearance Sonar (ICS) (Parking Support Brakes [Stationary Objects]), which helps prevent accidents caused by pressing the wrong pedal.
 
Active Safety

Toyota Safety Sense (Active Safety Package)
The Toyota Safety Sense system incorporates three major functions considered effective in reducing serious traffic accidents causing death or injury. It packages multiple active safety functions, based around Pre-collision Safety (PCS), which works to either help avoid collisions with cars ahead or pedestrians, Lane Departure Alert (LDA), which contributes to preventing accidents caused by leaving the lane, and Automatic High Beam (AHB), which helps ensure clear sight in front at night.
In January 2018, functions for detecting nighttime pedestrians and daytime crossing cyclists were added to the Alphard and Vellfire. Additionally, adoption of the advanced driving support feature Lane Tracing Assist (LTA), which can lead to autonomous driving, will help reduce the load on the driver on highways. Since its market launch in 2015, Toyota Safety Sense has been installed in a total of more than 10 million vehicles globally (as of October 2018).
Toyota Safety Sense is now available on nearly all passenger cars (as standard or option) in the Japanese,
 
 		United States, and European markets. It has also been introduced in a total of 68 countries and regions,

Pedal Misapplication Prevention System
About 30 percent of all traffic accidents are said to occur in parking lots.1 Furthermore, drivers who are 75 years or older tend to be responsible for a large percentage of accidents caused by pedal misapplication in parking lots and other areas.2 To help remedy this situation, Toyota has so far installed ICS in approximately 90 percent of all vehicles sold, including compact cars.
Meanwhile, as for vehicles that are already owned by customers, Toyota is successively expanding the number of vehicle models that can be retrofitted with the pedal misapplication prevention system. We
began selling the pedal misapplication prevention system in December 2018 targeting five vehicle models

Accident Reduction Effects
 

Outside Evaluations of Safety
 
In real traffic environments, installation of the ICS in cars has reduced the number of accidents caused by	 	 pedal misapplication by about 70 percent. It has also been confirmed that the ICS in combination with
Toyota Safety Sense has reduced rear-end collisions by about 90 percent (Toyota comparison).

Passive safety combines a body structure that absorbs collision energy with devices that efficiently protect the vehicle occupants in order to minimize collision damage.
In 1995, Toyota set up unique, stringent internal goals related to passive safety performance called “Global Outstanding Assessment (GOA),” in order to pursue world-leading safety levels, and developed a collision- safety body and passenger protection devices. Since then, to maintain leadership in this field, Toyota has continued to advance GOA, improving the real safety performance of its vehicles in a wide variety of accidents.
To analyze the human body injury mechanism, we developed and evolved Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS), a virtual human body model that simulates effects on human bodies that cannot be measured using dummies. THUMS has been utilized in predicting injuries to the various parts of the human body. Furthermore, based on our Integrated Safety Management Concept, we are working on technology development for preventive link functions that operate protective devices in a collision by linking with the Pre-collision Safety (PCS) system. We have developed functions that prepare to deploy the seatbelt mechanism or SRS* side & curtain shield airbags to protect the occupants when the PCS determines that a collision with another vehicle is likely, or prepare to deploy the pop-up hood to protect the pedestrian or cyclist when the PCS determines that a collision with a pedestrian or cyclist is likely.

Emergency Response

Every minute counts in emergency response to accidents or sudden illness. In 2000, Toyota rolled out HELPNET® service, an emergency reporting system utilizing the G-Book information network (the current T-Connect) and G-Link. In the event of an accident or sudden illness, HELPNET® contacts a dedicated operator who will arrange for rapid dispatch of an emergency vehicle with police or fire department responders. The service automatically contacts an operator when the airbag deploys and supports the
D-Call Net® which makes quick deployment decisions for air ambulances, etc. now available nationwide. This service is provided by sending vehicle data to the HELPNET center from an on-board data communication module (DCM).
We installed DCM as a standard feature in the Crown and Corolla Sports, launched in June 2018, and aim to equip all new passenger vehicles in the Japanese market with DCM.

In January 2011, with the goal of establishing safer and more reliable transportation means, Toyota established the CSRC inside the Toyota Technical Center (TTC) located in the state of Michigan. The
first-phase project was completed at the CSRC in March 2017. Over a five-year period, the CSRC started and completed 44 research projects jointly with 23 universities and research organizations, publishing more than 200 technical papers.
Furthermore, the CSRC has been making its research results public through presentations at various vehicle safety-related conferences so that these results can be utilized by people engaged in the development of vehicle and traffic safety technologies.
In 2017, Toyota started a new second-phase project called “CSRC Next.”
This reflects Toyota’s position that it is important to understand how humans will cope with advancing vehicle technologies. Toyota will invest 35 million dollars over five years, focusing on the issues related to

Automated Driving	Initiatives Targeting People

 
To help achieve Zero Casualties from Traffic Accidents, Toyota has been conducting research and development on automated driving technologies since the 1990s. Toyota’s unique approach to automated driving, called the “Mobility Teammate Concept,” seeks out a relationship between people and vehicles so they stand by and support one another as companions would. Based on this philosophy, Toyota is aiming to help realize a world in which every person, including the elderly and the physically challenged, can enjoy mobility safely, easily, and freely.
With regard to safety in particular, based on the concept of “Guardian,” which is intended to enhance the driver’s abilities rather than replace them, the human driver is assumed to be always in control of the car. If there is a risk of accident or if one is imminent, Guardian tries to help avoid the accident by working with the driver’s maneuvers.
 
Believing that educating people is also important for preventing traffic accidents, Toyota started donating traffic safety teaching materials for small children in the form of traffic safety picture books and story-telling card sets given to children starting kindergarten and nursery school nationwide in the 1960s, in cooperation with Toyota dealers nationwide. Since then, Toyota has been holding the Toyota Safety School designed for small children every year. In 2005, we established the Toyota Safety Education Center Mobilitas at the Fuji Speedway. We also hold Toyota Driver Communication, a safe driving technique seminar aimed at drivers.
Additionally, with the spread of the Safety Support Car (Sapo Car) program recommended by the government, we are working with Toyota dealers to continue to spread our safety technologies further and keep our customers informed. This is why we are rolling out Support Toyota (the overall name for our safety and assurance activities) to help achieve car lifestyles that offer safety and assurance.

Customer First and Quality First Measures


 
   Fundamental Approach	

The origins of Toyota’s “Customer First” and “Quality First” principles lie in the Five Main Principles of Toyoda, which embody the thinking of Sakichi Toyoda, and the spirit of audit and improvement of Kiichiro Toyoda. Since its foundation, Toyota has established a corporate culture that focuses particular attention on quality that will produce customer smiles and on kaizen (continuous improvement) achieved through genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience). In accordance with our commitment to quality as stated in the Toyota Global Vision, each employee in every area maintains a constant and strong awareness of issues and a sense of ownership and makes ongoing efforts to implement kaizen and to collaborate closely with personnel in other fields to enhance customer safety, peace of mind, and satisfaction.

Initiatives to Improve Quality

Toyota sees quality as a combination of product quality, sales and service quality, and the quality of work performed by each employee that serves, as the foundation supporting the other aspects of quality.
We believe that products and services that gain the confidence of customers can be only created when all employees who engage in every process, from development, purchasing, production, and sales to after-sales service activities, build quality into their work and implement the quality assurance cycle by linking the various processes.

Toyota’s Concept of Quality

 
 
Organization and Structure
The fundamentals of these actions are function management and policy management.
Function management refers to setting company-wide policies based on functional parameters such as quality and safety, with each group and company taking action in collaboration with other divisions. Policy management refers to the formulation and implementation of plans for achieving targets in each group and company, based on the company-wide policy. In terms of policy management for quality functions, Toyota established a Quality Function Policy each year as a plan for addressing company-wide quality issues and ensuring quality corresponding to new businesses and technologies. Toyota deploys this policy within its company , reports progress and results through the Quality Function Board and other platforms, and takes actions as needed.

In addition, in order to strengthen quality improvement activities led by the regions, Toyota has appointed Chief Quality Officers (CQOs) in Japan and other regions around the world. Among the meetings of the Quality Function Board, the highest-order global conferences held several times each year, the one in January requires CQOs from all regions to attend and discuss future quality function policies.

Additionally, each region has organized a variety of quality-related conferences. For the highest-order conference chaired by the regional CQO, TMC sends its Global CQO or a secretariat member in order to facilitate and support better communication and collaboration. Toyota also shares its quality function policies with its affiliated group companies and suppliers, promoting collaborative actions for ensuring quality.

Global Policy Implementation Structure and the Quality Conference
 

In addition to posting the status of the series of recall issues, current quality issues are added every year to renew the program. We are making these efforts to create key education facilities for maintaining focus on all that Toyota learned. We have also set up customer quality learning centers unique to individual plants and overseas sites, and are working to ensure employees in each region and each plant thoroughly understand the importance of quality. Additionally, employees who experienced the series of recall issues take on the role of storyteller to convey the experiences and lessons learned within their own work sites.
On Toyota Restart Day in 2019, Chairman Uchiyamada himself was a storyteller in a roundtable discussion held with storytellers from various work sites. He compared the situation at the time of the recall issues and the current situation, and highlighted the risk of forgetting the lessons learned. Some of the participating storytellers commented, “We must convey our spirit, not just knowledge,” and “The discussion helped me renew a sense of crisis in a positive way,” reaffirming the validity of the storytelling initiative.
 



 
Establishing Quality Assurance Structure toward Transformation into a “Mobility” Company As the automotive industry faces an era of profound transformation, the likes of which come only once every 100 years, Toyota is taking many steps to transform itself into a “mobility” company.
In the mobility society that will arrive in the future, in addition to automobiles’ basic safety and comfort (quality of things), in such areas as running, turning, and stopping, it is necessary to ensure the quality and security of the communication automobiles use to connect to people, things, and cities. The quality of the telecommunication platform and servers, which control the operations of services, must also be ensured in order to guarantee the
 







Coping with Quality Problems
 





Roundtable discussion with Chairman Uchiyamada
 
quality of customers’ experiences (quality of experiences) obtained through mobility services.
With this in mind, Toyota is also making company-wide efforts to strengthen the quality assurance process, including in its services, in order to provide high-quality products and services that bring a smile to customers’ faces in its mobility businesses.

Storytelling Activities to Maintain Focus on the Series of Recall Issues
February 24, the day that President Akio Toyoda attended U.S. Congressional hearings, held to investigate the series of recall issues that occurred in 2010, was designated “Toyota Restart Day.” We are creating mechanisms and taking measures to raise awareness in order to maintain focus on the lessons learned from the experiences Toyota underwent at that time.
For example, in 2014 Toyota established its Customer Quality Learning Center as education facility for conveying the experiences and lessons Toyota learned from the series of recall issues to future generations of employees. Using exhibits that appeal to the five senses, such as actual examples of faulty parts and vehicle simulators, the center acts as an important education facility for conveying the situation back then to current Toyota employees.
 
We have a system whereby each employee takes action to enhance quality in accordance with the
Customer First Principle, and prepares for and responds in a timely manner to quality-related issues. When making recall decisions, quality failures are determined not simply based on legal compliance, but also from the customer’s perspective, putting safety and assurance first.
Final decisions are made with the participation of regional representatives, who are closest to customers, so that feedback from regional customers is accurately reflected. After a decision to recall is made, Toyota contacts individual customers through dealers, and additionally posts information on its website to ensure prompt repair service.

Customer First Measures

Toyota’s principle of Customer First exists for the purpose of providing customers with products and services that earn their smiles. Toyota hopes to offer cars with superior features in terms of environmental, safety and quality performance, while also offering the intrinsic appeal of cars, such as high driving performance, at an affordable price.
We humbly and obediently accept information provided by our dealers and customer feedback received at customer assistance centers, taking them to heart and utilizing them for making ever-better cars.


System for Implementing Customer Feedback (Japan)
In order to respond to customer inquiries, opinions, and requests, the most recent customer feedback is gathered from dealers. Also, we established the customer assistance centers and are taking actions which lead to the creation of ever-better cars and services.
 

Toyota Customer Assistance Center and Lexus Information Desk
The Toyota Customer Assistance Center and the Lexus Information Desk are open for consultation 365 days a year, and have established a structure designed to ensure constant customer satisfaction.
Toyota offers speedy, appropriate and empathetic responses to customer inquiries, and listens to opinions and requests, based on the principle of Customer First. At the same time, Toyota addresses all issues while also maintaining close cooperation with its dealers. Furthermore, the Salesperson Support Desk has been established in order to support dealers in implementing the Customer First principle.
Toyota also conducts surveys of customers who use our telephone service via an automated response system, in an effort to continuously make further improvements.

Ongoing Customer First Staff Education
To coincide with the designation of every May as Consumer’s Month by the Japanese government, Toyota has declared it Customer’s Month, and undertakes initiatives aimed at spreading awareness of the Customer First principle throughout the company. The Customer Feedback Exhibitions present feedback from customers not just in Japan but around the world, as well as initiatives taken from the customer’s perspective. The exhibitions serve as forums for each employee to reconfirm the importance of listening to customer feedback.
As part of employee education, “Experience and Learn from Customer Feedback” sessions are held to observe and experience the functioning of our call center, the Customer Assistance Center. A Customer Feedback Board summarizing customer feedback has been posted on the company intranet, drawing employee attention to issues of concern to customers.
Furthermore, we are actively encouraging some of our employees to obtain the Consumer Affairs Advisor qualification, which is certified by the Japanese Prime Minister. Facility and vehicle evaluation from the customer’s viewpoint is also held by a group of experts, the Toyota Consumer Affairs Advisor Group.

After-sales Services Measures

To bring smiles to the faces of as many customers as possible, it is essential to simultaneously achieve both better cars and better services. Customer car use requires regular check-ups, legally mandated inspections, and repairs following breakdowns or accidents. After-sales service provides safety, peace of mind, and comfort to customers at these times, and continues support for the Toyota and Lexus brands. In recent years, the average duration of car use has been lengthening (as of the end of March 2018, the average vehicle age excluding minivehicles in Japan was 13.2 years, increasing by 1.6 years from 10 years ago). As a result, the role of after-sales service is becoming increasingly important. More than 100 million Toyota vehicles are currently owned worldwide and each of them is irreplaceable to the customer. Toyota is taking measures to provide ever-better services in accordance with the concept of the 3S Spirit (Seikaku + Shinsetsu = Shinrai: Accuracy + Caring = Trust) so that we can achieve high levels of customer satisfaction in using their Toyota vehicles.

Organization and Structure
Better service means the ability to safely, accurately, promptly, and inexpensively perform maintenance and repairs in cases of breakdown. To do this, we are working to enhance the serviceability of vehicles so they can be repaired quickly and the availability of service parts, and to develop service engineers.
Based on the idea that after-sales services begin at the stage of vehicle development, we believe that serviceability is also one aspect of a car’s performance, and incorporate serviceability improvement based on market feedback into vehicle development. Toyota has also established a system to deliver parts exactly when they are needed to countries around the world so that repairs and other services can be completed in a timely manner. Parts inventories and inspection work are being made more efficient by applying Toyota Production System concepts at dealer worksites.

In terms of tools for supporting service operations, the number of diagnostic codes for identifying failure causes has been increased. When the on-board computer performs self-diagnosis and detects a failure, it sends the diagnostic code for the failed part to the dealer so that the part causing the problem in the vehicle can be quickly identified. We are also taking innovative steps to improve service operation efficiency by reducing the number of frequently performed operations or automating them.
Service, technology, sales, and other divisions are collaborating on repair techniques to deploy easy-to- repair car manufacturing. They also provide necessary information quickly and make repair work speedy and easy.
There are currently approximately 180,000 Toyota personnel involved in after-sales service in Japan and overseas, and educational systems and facilities are being established in each region. The Tajimi Service Center in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, plays a central role in enhancing the knowledge and technical skills of service staff worldwide.
 
Training Centers Develop Global Service Technical Staff
The Tajimi Service Center in Gifu Prefecture, Japan provides training on service technologies and sheet metal painting to service engineers from dealers in Japan and overseas distributors worldwide.
The Tajimi Service Center, which opened in July 2013, includes classrooms, practice fields, and drive evaluation courses with a variety of road conditions on a vast 187,000 m2 site. In FY2019, a total of approximately 2,100 staff members from 18 sites in Japan and overseas were trained at the center, bringing the cumulative total number of attendees to approximately 11,800.
The Center has completed the R&D functions for the latest service technologies compatible with the service, repair, and sheet metal painting/repair of Toyota cars on the market that are equipped with state- of-the-art technology. These new technologies will increase the knowledge and improve the technical skills of staff members who come to the center for training from all over the world, contributing to the creation of a foundation for reinforcing global competitiveness in service technology.
 

Measures to Help Customers Use Their Vehicles Safely
To help customers enjoy driving their vehicles safely and comfortably, user’s manuals are created and information on the latest models is posted on the Toyota website. We are also taking steps utilizing the product information provision tools for distributors and dealers, as well as the company website to accurately communicate the risks resulting from operational errors.

Initiative with Toyota National Dealers’ Advisory Council to Listen Directly to Customer Feed
Since dealers offer services to customers directly, Toyota is working with dealers to provide ever-better cars and ever-better services.
In Japan, the sectional meetings of Toyota National Dealers’ Advisory Council and Toyota are discussing after-sales services.
Technical Sectional Meetings, which have been held regularly since 1977, investigate quality issues and serviceability from the customer’s perspective. At Service Meetings, held since 1990, various issues regarding the service sites of dealers are investigated. The results of both meetings are used to implement improvements.

Toyota’s Social Contribution Activities which Started with Sakichi Toyoda’s Hope for People’s Happiness
Toyota’s social contribution activities trace their roots to Sakichi Toyoda, the father of Toyota Motor
Corporation’s founder, Kiichiro Toyoda. In 1925, Sakichi pledged one million yen (at the time) to the Imperial Institute of Invention and Innovation to encourage battery-related inventions to support inventions that would enrich people’s lives. The invention of such batteries proved to be extremely difficult, and none have yet been completed. Nevertheless, the resulting progress in batteries for cars has had a tremendous impact on industries and people’s lives. Even after
Sakichi’s death, this spirit was handed down to Kiichiro and others who started the automotive industry in Japan, through the desire to contribute to the development and welfare of the country and feelings of gratitude. This spirit was later incorporated into the Five Main Principles of Toyoda, the Guiding
Principles at Toyota, and the Toyota Global Vision.

Respect for Human Rights


 
   Fundamental Approach	

Toyota complies with local, national and international laws and regulations as well as the spirit thereof and we conduct our business operations with honesty and integrity. Furthermore, in order to contribute to sustainable development, we believe that management interacting with its stakeholders is of considerable importance, and we endeavor to build and maintain sound relationships with our stakeholders through open and fair communication.

Human Rights as an Essential Foundation of Labor Relations
Toyota respects the basic human rights of all individuals, including our employees and those in our supply chain. Toyota is a company that practices the philosophy of “Respect for People.” We share a common belief that every Toyota employee has the infinite capability to better themselves, the company, and society. The integration of such achievements by our employees will bring company growth. This growth allows our company to provide decent employment, which in turn, allows our members to build trust in the company and provide further productivity improvements.
Each employee’s contribution towards the creation of a work environment that promotes safety & health, respects each employee’s dignity, is inclusive, and that is free of discrimination and harassment is essential to ensuring a decent work environment, which will lead to the productivity improvement needed for company growth. Discrimination, unhealthy, and unsafe work environments are not only violations of human rights, they are also conditions that will negatively impact employee performance. Since our employees spend a considerable amount of time at work we aim to create positive working conditions and environments that will allow them to excel.
In addition, the contributions and cooperation of all our stakeholders are essential to providing satisfying products and services to our customers. We have continued manufacturing vehicles up to this point thanks to the support of many individuals. Going forward, we will continue to engage our employees and show respect to all of our stakeholders as we continue to contribute to society as a mobility company.
At present, with our customers’ needs and the very concept of automobiles constantly changing, Toyota is endeavoring to transform itself from an automobile company to a mobility company, that is, a company that provides all kinds of services related to people’s mobility. As we face new competitors and a changing business domain, Toyota’s employees are each harnessing their knowledge and giving their best efforts to survive in an environment marked by constant, major change, with Toyota’s management philosophy of “Respect for People” serving as the foundation. To meet the expectations of our stakeholders, we also
 
refer to international norms such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to tackle issues related to human rights.

Employees of Toyota Motor North America


UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework
Toyota has formulated an internal policy related to human rights and refers to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and other international norms when promoting it. To fulfill our responsibility to respect human rights, we have identified “risks that have an adverse impact on human rights” based on the scale and properties of our businesses, relief possibilities, stakeholder expectations, and so on that must be given priority. Currently, we have identified the three areas of “freedom of association,” “precarious work,” and “supply chain due diligence” as risks that have an adverse impact on human rights, and we are making them our priority. In addition, Toyota has also developed its Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines (see page 27) based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Freedom of Association
In Toyota’s “Respect for People” management-philosophy, we aim to respect individual capabilities, ways of thinking, and creativity and harness them fully. To do this, it is necessary to make sure that all employees are on the same page regarding the company’s management situation, the surrounding environment, and management issues, and we emphasize thorough dialogue with employees. In addition, based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we respect our employees’ right to freely associate while also respecting their right not to be compelled to belong to an association in compliance with the laws of the countries in which we operate.
Regardless of whether or not there is a labor union, Toyota has taken every opportunity it can to engage in thorough dialogue with employees and build healthy labor relations. We believe that dialogue and

discussion with employees or their appropriate representatives is part of these kinds of relationships between labor and management. Moreover, to ascertain the status of dialogue with employees and issues related to freedom of association, we periodically send out and collect questionnaires from our subsidiaries and request that improvement be made to policies and activities based on the responses. For affiliates that require concentrated initiatives, associates from the Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) are dispatched to review policies and activities, and work with the affiliate in question to enhance communication with and training for employees regarding Toyota’s policies concerning freedom of association and legal compliance.

Precarious Work
The term non-permanent workers refers to temporary workers, contract employees, dispatch employees, and so on. This status is marked by a number of uncertain and unstable characteristics, such as uncertain employment periods, low wages, and low employee benefits. Our
 

Supply Chain Due Diligence
Automobiles are comprised of approximately 30,000 parts, and because the supply chain is extremely broad and deep, we are aware that preventing adverse impacts on human rights in our supply chain is a theme we should prioritize. So, we established a workshop for suppliers that are particularly large and difficult to replace in order to share incidents to be wary of and examples of problem solving.
Toyota adheres to the principle of mutual trust and mutual responsibility between labor and management and aims to collaborate with suppliers to contribute to sustainable societal development as well as the earth’s sustainability. It also strives to comply with the laws of various countries and regions while protecting human rights and performing activities that contribute to both local communities and the international community.

Education Related to Human Rights
Toyota invests in the education of our members and suppliers in relation to anti-discrimination, open and honest dialogue, as well as
 

Labor Relations Training for Supplier Executives
Labor relations training for suppliers is held about 10 times per year, primarily as preparation for executives from the head office of our main suppliers in Japan who are being transferred to overseas suppliers. At the training, a variety of areas are covered, including best practices for building positive labor-management relationships, information on past labor disputes, labor-management negotiations, and the latest trends in human rights, international norms, and regulations.
 
businesses require personnel equipped with both a deep understanding of Toyota values and advanced skills, and because a long period of time is required to cultivate such personnel, Toyota strives to provide stable
 
human rights related matters. Training is conducted both at TMC and affiliates in conjunction with our group companies and Tier 1 suppliers. Targets of the training include supplier executives, TMC

employment even when the external environment is harsh. At the same time, because it is engaged in the automobile industry, in which demand is greatly influenced by new products and seasonal factors, Toyota hires a certain number of temporary personnel for a certain period either directly or indirectly to respond to these fluctuations. For this reason, in addition to each affiliate hiring non-permanent workers based on the customs and labor laws of each region, Toyota also strives to avoid inappropriate working conditions and employment.
First, we confirm the composition of employees at affiliates in various countries, and for non-permanent employment relationships, we identify affiliates requiring prioritized examination. TMC associates are dispatched to identified affiliate sites, and we implement improvements such as reallocations and reviews of employment rules related to contract terms when necessary. In addition, we review and continuously improve the working conditions of fixed-term contract employees at TMC.

Toyota’s Approaches to Conflict Minerals Issues

In recent years, there has been a concern that the minerals being mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries have become a major source of funding for armed groups. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires companies to investigate and disclose the use of conflict minerals (gold, tin, tantalum, and tungsten) in their products.

Toyota’s Policy on Conflict Minerals
Toyota has adopted Policies and Approaches to Conflict Minerals Issues and is dealing with the issues involved based on these guidelines.
Additionally, we revised the Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines in 2012, requesting our suppliers to engage in responsible material procurement.
 

Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry
Toyota has conducted a reasonable country of origin inquiry with due diligence throughout its global supply chain since 2013.
In 2018, Toyota again conducted a survey of its automotive, marine, and other businesses in line with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-affected and High-risk Areas.

Before conducting the survey, Toyota formulated a manual detailing how to fill in the survey sheet and developed a tool, both to be used by suppliers to compile survey results. Toyota also supported a briefing session co-sponsored by the Japan Auto Parts Industries Association (JAPIA)1 and the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA)2. We contacted suppliers who had not submitted a Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), and collected CMRTs from thousands of suppliers in total. We have reviewed suppliers’ CMRTs and requested them to make corrections if there are errors and/or omissions in order to improve our efforts associated with conflict minerals.

We are also making efforts to work with other industry groups on the issue of conflict minerals in Japan and overseas.
Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (TMNA), a U.S. subsidiary of Toyota, has participated in a working group set up by the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG)3, a U.S. group tasked with setting a code of conduct for the auto industry. TMNA has also been cooperating with the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)4 through activities of each working group. Through AIAG, we supported and contributed to RMI activities. Specifically, TMNA as Leader of AIAG’s Smelter Engagement Team contacted 29 smelters/refiners between January and December, 2018, and contacted an additional 34 smelters/refiners as Team-Lead of the Global Smelter Engagement Team. They performed surveys of smelters/refiners, visited their industry organizations, and encouraged those companies to participate in the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) and to conduct re-audits.
 

As a result of the industry-wide cooperation outlined above, the number of conflict-free smelters/refiners worldwide has been increased to 255 as of November 2018. Of these, 247 companies are included in Toyota’s 2018 survey results.
The survey results from January–December 2018 and Toyota’s initiatives were incorporated into Form SD and the Conflict Minerals Report, and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 31, 2019.

In order to contribute to society through car-manufacturing and monozukuri (manufacturing) and put into practice the principle of “Customer First,” it is necessary to share principles and collaborate with our business partners such as suppliers and dealers.
Toyota pursues open and fair business, and engages in sustainability initiatives through close collaboration with business partners to raise quality in terms of safety and customer satisfaction.
 
Since its establishment, Toyota has worked closely with its suppliers in its manufacturing. As part of these efforts, Toyota has globally implemented its Basic Purchasing Policies according to the spirit of mutual benefit based on mutual trust. We have close relationships with existing and new suppliers to promote “Customer First.”
To address the increasing interest in corporate social responsibility, including in our supply chain, we have dialogues with supplier executives.
Before conducting business transactions, we conclude contracts that clearly spell out legal compliance, respect for human rights, and considerations for local and global environments. Internally, we work to raise the awareness of all our employees, including buyers, through seminars and trainings.
Toyota is also committed to continue contributing to the sustainability of society and the earth by working with suppliers to ensure compliance, respect for human rights, and reduce negative environmental impact.

Implementation of the Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines
At Toyota, we believe it is important to cooperate with suppliers, and issued the Toyota Supplier CSR Guidelines in February 2009. Toyota suppliers are requested to implement their own activities based on the guidelines and in turn develop their individual policies and guidelines to be followed by their own suppliers.
Furthermore, in December 2012, Toyota revised the guidelines to more clearly indicate its principles regarding human rights issues (strengthening of monitoring and corrective actions, and approaches towards conflict minerals) in order to help enhance its suppliers’ initiatives.

   

 



Bribery Prevention
In response to the global expansion of its business and societal demands, Toyota adopted the Anti-Bribery Guidelines in 2012 to completely eliminate corruption.
Toyota is strengthening its preventive measures by deploying the Guidelines to our suppliers.
 
Suppliers’ Sustainability Activities
Toyota suppliers voluntarily hold CSR lectures and workshops, and engage in volunteer activities.
CSR lectures are held every year by Toyota’s supplier associations, Kyohokai and Eihokai, with the aim of improving member companies’ awareness and understanding of sustainability, and encouraging sustainability initiatives.
In FY2019, a lecture titled “Sustainable growth strategy that utilizes Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation” was given.
The automotive industry is facing an era of profound transformation, the likes of which comes only once every 100 years, and individual companies are being forced to strengthen their competitiveness.
Against this backdrop, the lecture provided an opportunity to consider specific strategies and business-model-related initiatives, improve corporate earning power, and share and recognize measures for sustainably enhancing corporate value, from the ESG (Environment, Society, and Governance) perspective as ways to respond to the new era.
Furthermore, Toyota also holds CSR Study Meetings every year to support the activities of its suppliers.
In FY2019, a CSR Study Meeting was held and attended by 450 people from 350 suppliers, focusing on sustainability trends and initiatives.
Toyota participates in the supplier CSR training program of the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG)* to support its overseas suppliers in their activities.
In the previous fiscal year, Toyota participated in the development of the Supplier Responsibility Training Project. This new e-learning program is available to suppliers on AIAG website. Toyota will continue working to help raise awareness across its supply chains.

Collaboration with Dealers
 
Toyota Gentaiken Program	Onsite Visit from Toyota Dealers Overseas
 

Dealers are the front line where Toyota’s “Customer First” policy is directly observed. Toyota and its dealers share the value of its products/services and always work as one to enhance customer satisfaction based on a strong relationship of trust through close two-way communication.
Toyota follows a “Customer First, Dealer Second, Manufacturer Third” concept. We support dealers in making concerted efforts to meet customer expectations in order to raise the level of customer satisfaction. We believe that, through these efforts, we will realize growth for both dealers and Toyota.

Support of Toyota Dealers in Japan
The Toyota National Dealers’ Advisory Council (TNDAC), which is comprised of Toyota dealers in Japan, established the CSR Study Group in 2005. TNDAC then reorganized it into the Compliance Study Group in 2016, which has been studying to ensure legal compliance and giving suggestions to all Toyota dealers in Japan. To help dealers carry out compliance activities, TNDAC distributes the Legal Compliance Manual, which explains major laws and regulations and summarizes the checkpoints, to dealers each year. Additionally, Toyota supports TNDAC and dealers in many ways, including the following:
•	Setting up a compliance support website that lists best practices from dealers
•	Providing information through seminars and lectures held by TNDAC
•	Providing support for revising the Legal Compliance Manual in response to revisions in laws and regulations
 
The Toyota Gentaiken Program aims to nurture future car fans by providing children of the “virtual era” with opportunities to gain real-life experience using their five senses and to experience the global environment and economy.
This program works together with local dealers to offer “traveling classrooms” at elementary schools in the area.
The theme of the classroom activities is to offer fun and hands-on experiences. The class for fourth graders teaches about the power and control of a car using a model and a real car in Car Gentaiken Class. The class for fifth graders provides a full understanding of cars, teaching the students about the relationship of cars to the environment and economics using quizzes or games, as part of learning about the automotive industry in their social studies class. In FY2019, the Car Gentaiken Class was conducted at 86 schools and the Class to Fully Understand Cars at 326 schools, for a total of 412 schools. Since starting in 2008, the program has provided classroom activities to approximately 180,000 children in 3,679 schools.

Fifth-grade classroom instruction
 
Every year, Toyota dealers throughout Japan host visits by Toyota dealers from all over the world who have expressed the desire to learn customer satisfaction (CS) activities.
They learn how Japanese dealers improve customer satisfaction and create more Toyota fans throughout the entire value chain, including new car sales, service, insurance, used cars, and credit. After genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience), they incorporate what they have learned into various activities at their own locations back home. Through active communication among dealers with different cultural backgrounds, these visits offer each dealer new ideas and learning opportunities.

Organization and Structure
Toyota’s sales operations are divided into six regions (excluding Japan) throughout the world: North America, Europe, China & Asia, East Asia/Oceania & the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America & Caribbean, to provide the best cars and services according to the market characteristics of each region. The car usage conditions and environment, as well as the required functions and services, can vary greatly depending on the country and region. Toyota strives to comprehend customer feedback in a timely manner through overseas dealers, in order to make ever-better cars.
In January 2019, Toyota transferred all of its sales and marketing operations for Africa to Toyota Tsusho Corporation, which has great strengths when it comes to doing business in Africa. Such a transfer is expected to concentrate the power of the Toyota Group for contributing to regional development through business and would enable the provision of “best-in-town” service.
By promoting greater work efficiency and strengthening their activities through this transfer, Toyota and Toyota Tsusho aim to provide better services to their customers in Africa.
Since 1984, a World Convention has been held every four years to bring together overseas distributors and executives of Toyota. At this convention, Toyota expresses its appreciation for the hard work and shares its policies, to make it an opportunity to reaffirm further improvement of customer satisfaction.

   Fundamental Approach	

Toyota’s philosophy for its employees, who support the stable base of its business, is institutionalized as the Toyota Way in Human Resources Management.
The aim of the Toyota Way in Human Resources Management is to realize management with respect for people, that is, providing all employees with opportunities to achieve social contribution and self-realization through their work, and enabling them to exercise their abilities to think, to be creative, and to perform. For this aim to be achieved, “a relationship of mutual trust and mutual responsibility between labor and management*” is essential, in which the company gives the highest priority to ensuring stable employment and strives to improve labor conditions, while all employees execute their duties and responsibilities for the prosperity of the company. This philosophy is shared by all Toyota affiliates around the world, where it is reflected and implemented in management and various policies based on the features of each region.
Toyota believes that these initiatives will lead not only to management with respect for people, but also to customer satisfaction and social contribution, and thus the sustainable growth of the company and society.
 
Organization and Structure
At Toyota, Global HR members discuss how to create good working environments where employees can work with trust, how to develop frameworks to enhance constant and proactive kaizen (continuous improvement), how to develop people, and how to create a sense of unity for teamwork through daily communication and periodic conferences.
These discussions are reflected in the global HR Function Guidelines (HRFG) and each affiliate’s HR hoshin the following year in order to realize the Toyota Way in Human Resources Management.

Results of Employee Satisfaction Survey
By providing its employees with opportunities to achieve social contribution and self-realization through their work, Toyota aims to enable all employees to exercise their abilities to think, to be creative, and to perform. Toyota uses its employee satisfaction surveys to measure the results of these efforts and utilizes the analysis results for planning and implementing measures to make a better workplace.

Creating Attractive Workplaces
In order to strengthen its human resource base for sustainable growth, Toyota has created a working environment in which employees can work with confidence and feel safe. Toyota strives to foster employees’ pride and loyalty to the company by encouraging a culture of teamwork through communication.
Employee teams, including those from overseas affiliates, competed in the annual Toyota Relay Race (HURE! hure! Ekiden). The enthusiastic cheering from more than 30,000 spectators enhanced the sense of unity and boosted morale within Toyota.

Promoting Various Sports, from Company Teams to Classes for Children
Toyota is working to help create affluent communities by promoting various sports. Since our founding in 1937, Toyota has focused particularly on company sports.
The players’ commitment to challenge, teamwork and never giving up embodies the spirit of Toyota. Coworkers playing hard increase employee motivation and provide excitement in the workplace. There are currently 33 sports clubs and 18 individual athletes who are training to compete in Olympic and Paralympic Games. They have achieved high rankings at competitions.
In addition, we sent Toyota athletes to lead “Dream Classes” at elementary schools in Toyota City, and provided support for sports classes offered by dealers and sports events held by local communities.

Safety and Health


   Fundamental Approach	

Ensuring the safety and health of employees has been one of Toyota’s most important long-standing business activities and will continue to be so, going forward. Upon assuming the position of General Safety and Health Supervisor in 1957, then Senior Managing Officer Eiji Toyoda explained his basic stance on safety and health: “Safe work is the ‘gate’ to all work. Let us pass through this gate.” Toyota has handed these words down as its Basic Philosophy for Safety and Health, incorporating the strong desire that employees never be involved in an occupational accident.
This is why we are using the PDCA cycle to improve priority policies implemented under the leadership of company-wide safety and health managers (operating officers), as part of our overall safety and health activities.
For health promotion, we hold discussions with the Toyota Motor Health Insurance Society, labor unions and industrial health personnel (human resources, safety & health) to take health support measures.
In September 2017, President Akio Toyoda announced the “Proclamation of Health Commitment: Aiming at Becoming a Health-first Company.” This proclamation states that the physical and mental health of our employees is the “driving force of good performance,” and Toyota actively supports the “challenge to improve your lifestyle” for each employee and engages in initiatives for “health promotion and illness prevention.”
Dialogues are held between labor and management at each work site to cooperatively resolve these issues of safety and health according to the specific situations at each location.
Furthermore, the KPIs of safety and health are reported as important issues at Executive Meetings on a regular basis.

Promoting a Three-pillar Approach to Safety	Global Safety Measures
 
We have promoted the interactive development of safety and health based on our safety and health function policy. For safety, we work to ensure that our management takes the leadership and that everyone adheres to the basic rules. Under the slogan of “Eventually achieving zero accidents and the continuation of zero accidents at all worksites,” we will intensify efforts toward the three pillars of safety: human resource development (raising awareness of hazards through education and on-the-job training and conducting programs with the participation of all personnel), risk management (developing safety management systems), and environmental and facility preparation (providing safe machinery and comfortable workplace environments).
If any incidents occur, we will promptly communicate the relevant information to all general managers to ensure that the same incident does not recur.

Accident Frequency Rate (Frequency Rate of Lost Workday Cases)
 
Toyota regional headquarters take the lead in promoting safety and health measures in each region. We are currently working with each region to develop an occupational safety and health management system (OSHMS) globally. Along with unique regional requirements, we have established requirements that are shared throughout global Toyota based on ISO 45001*. Using OSHMS, weaknesses are identified by genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience) to improve safety management. For example, we confirm whether measures are being implemented to avoid accidents that have occurred at the sites of other affiliates, and that a system has been created to ensure the effort is active and continuous.
Toyota also holds an annual global safety meeting, attended by managers from all regions who are responsible for safety and health, and who study measures for common issues and can share information on best practices.

Safety Initiatives with Business Partners (Japan)
At Toyota, we are providing opportunities to communicate and tackle each issue to ensure safety for business partners on the premises, in order to create a friendly work environment.
For example, when performing routine cleaning and inspection of equipment, improvements are made, such as adding lights for dark work spaces or placing non-slip treads on slippery footholds.
In order to mutually raise the level of safety awareness, we are cooperating with All Toyota Safety and Health Cooperating Association, comprised of 17 Toyota Group companies; Toyota Motor Corp. Safety and Health Cooperating Association, comprised of suppliers;Kyohokai, a supplier association comprised of parts and materials suppliers that have close business relationships with TMC; and Eihokai, comprised of equipment and logistics suppliers.


 

Recognized as a 2019 Certified Health & Productivity Management Outstanding Organization
For the second year in a row, Toyota was certified as a 2019 Certified Health & Productivity Management Outstanding Organization (Major Corporations), certifying that we carry out outstanding health policies and activities in our health management. This is based on the idea that if a company values the health of their employees, it will create a workplace that allows employees to stay energetic and motivated, resulting in improved performance and growth for the company. This certifies us as a corporation that carries out strategic initiatives to manage employee health from a management perspective.

 
 
Building up Good Health (Japan)
Starting in FY2018, we have been promoting the Healthy Lifestyles Challenge 8 program as an activity to prevent illness.
This program encourages employees to make improvements in their health-related practices in eight areas to maintain and enhance their mental and physical health: (1) appropriate weight (BMI), (2) breakfast, (3) drinking, (4) snacking, (5) exercise, (6) smoking, (7) sleep, and (8) stress. The aim is to develop mentally and physically healthy people, encouraging each employee to examine one or more issue to raise awareness and adopt healthier practices.
Reports indicating the status of implementing the eight health- related practices are provided and checked against the Healthy Lifestyles Challenge 8 Implementation Sheets on which health behavior targets are set and implementation status is checked weekly. A smartphone application is also provided to check the number of steps walked and the eight health-related practices.
In addition, feedback on the Healthy Lifestyles Challenge 8 results is provided to each division along with support such as exercise instruction and health lectures to promote the development of health-related customs and culture at each workplace. In addition, company cafeterias are offering low-calorie, nutritionally-balanced meals to support improvement in eating habits. We also promote no smoking inside the office floor to prevent second-hand smoke.
 

Health Support Center “WELPO”

The WELPO health support center conducts quadrennial physical examinations for all employees and their spouses (dependents) aged 36 years or older, as well as employees stationed overseas, with the aim of detecting cancer early and preventing lifestyle-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome. The center also offers health workshops that match the health status of individuals.
By providing employees and their spouses relaxed time to reflect on their health and lifestyle habits, the center helps them take concrete steps toward being healthy.

Health Support Center “WELPO”


Mental Health Care Measures (Japan)
To actively promote good mental health, we provide both mandatory and optional trainings, such as Self-care Training and Line Care Training, with the aim of preventing mental health problems from either occurring or recurring.
Self-care Training targets new and young employees and helps raise awareness on how to identify warning signs and deal with stress.
Line Care Training includes psychological training, as well as case- study-based training for newly-appointed managers. Listener Training is for supervisors who directly supervise subordinates.
Trainees receive advice on how to communicate at workplaces and collaborate with industrial health personnel.
We established internal guidelines on mental health measures for employees, and industrial health personnel, personnel in charge of human resources, and the employee’s colleagues work together to ensure a smooth return to the workplace and provide daily support.

Human Resources Development


 
   Fundamental Approach	

Toyota is committed to developing human resources with the philosophy that “Monozukuri is about Developing People.” For sustainable growth, we need to make improvements each day. In order to realize “Ever-better Cars” and “Customer First,” all employees need to share the same values regardless of different cultures and customs. To ensure this, Toyota develops global OJT based on the Toyota Way for sustainable growth.

Five Key Values for The Toyota Way





Practice of the Toyota Way
We have organized and arranged methods and techniques into “Global Content” to share the values and ways of thinking of The Toyota Way so that it can be understood and practiced by Toyota employees around the world.
This Global Content is practiced by Toyota employees through training and OJT both in Japan and overseas.
 
Evaluation of and Feedback to Each Employee in Relation to Principles and Hoshin
Daily work (topics and roles) of Toyota employees are derived from annual direction (hoshin). Evaluation and feedback are based on close communications between subordinates and superiors.
Specifically, topics and roles are determined at the beginning of each fiscal year and employees consult with their supervisors periodically. Through these consultations, supervisors assess the employees’ self-evaluations and provide feedback. Repeating this cycle leads to human resource development. Results for each half year are reflected in bonuses and performance abilities are reflected in raises for the following year.

Global Human Resource Development Structures	TMC’s Human Resource Development (Japan)

 
With the aim of sharing the values of the Toyota Way globally, Toyota is providing trainings through global executive human resource development, TMC human resource development undertaken by TMC, and overseas affiliate human resource development undertaken by affiliates in each region.
 
Management Human Resource Development
All personnel who are promoted to senior professional/senior management or senior managers undergo one-year, rank-specific training.
The training is based on group training and seminars that include discussions in small groups. Officers and general manager class employees serve as instructors to strengthen a culture of learning and teaching.
Training for selected managers is also conducted to develop executive human resources candidates. These personnel work on management issues, attend overseas business schools for short periods, and attend leadership programs for executives in Japan. In this way, opportunities are created for top management to directly observe personnel in these positions and to foster executive minds for the candidates.
 

 

 	 



Global Executive Human Resource Development
The Global 21 Program is to provide skilled global employees with knowledge suitable for global Toyota executives and to exercise their strengths to the best of their ability in their respective areas of responsibility. The program comprises the following three pillars.
1.	Indication of management philosophy and expectations of executives
The Toyota Way and Global Vision are disseminated and incorporated into global human resource evaluations and training.
2.	Human resource management
Evaluation standards and processes are standardized globally to ensure fairness and consistency. There are five major areas of evaluation: issue creativity, issue execution capabilities, organizational management capabilities, human resource utilization capabilities and leadership.
3.	Training deployment and training programs
Global assignments and executive training are carried out. Development of human resources at overseas affiliates is based on local training together with OJT at TMC to learn Toyota ways of performing work. TMC’s human resource development includes programs corresponding to Global 21 within TMC training program.
 
Administrative and Engineering Human Resource Development
Practice of the Toyota Way is positioned as the foundation of human resource development. OJT focuses on genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience), while off-the-job training (OFF-JT) opportunities for growth are also created with the guidance of supervisors or superiors.
For example, employees first participate in group training to learn steps for problem solving and then apply them to actual issues in their work duties.
For one year after hiring, new employees undergo comprehensive training on fundamental knowledge in various areas. In the third and sixth to eighth years of employment, young and mid-career employees undergo group training consisting of the five pillars of OJT in accordance with the Global Vision.

Five Pillars of OJT for Young and Mid-career Employees

	Specific Measures

Making ever-better cars	Comparison of new vehicles and competing vehicles
Enriching the lives of communities	Participation in volunteer activities
Customer First	Learning customer feedback at call centers

Dispatch Program for Young Employees
The dispatch program for young employees overseas was expanded from 2014 to accelerate the early development of young employees.
Employees working for more than four years are dispatched to overseas affiliates, overseas graduate programs (including MBA programs), or domestic affiliates for one to two years. Their mission is to acquire practical skills, deepen their understanding of different cultures, and improve their language skills.
In 2018, 373 employees were dispatched.

Shop Floor Employee Human Resource Development
OJT is conducted by supervisors and superiors at worksites. Focus is placed on the cycle of clarification of goals and development plans, development and assignment, and evaluation/feedback.
Programs include OFF-JT, including rank-specific training and training for managers/supervisors, as well as OJT and OFF-JT combined for acquiring knowledge and technical skills.
The workplace environment is changing with a declining birth rate and aging population, a shrinking workforce, and diversification of worksite members. It is necessary for worksite members to maximize results to maintain production.
Specifically, we take measures to support employees who return to work until 65 after retirement at age 60 and female shop floor employees. In order to respond flexibly to new technologies and changes in production systems, we specify evaluation down to the technical element unit. Start-up seminars are also held to support transferred employees to support efficient acquisition of work skills.


Human Resource Development of Overseas Employees at TMC Head Office

With the goal of promoting self-sufficiency in overseas affiliates, we temporarily transfer employees from overseas affiliates to TMC for OJT. Transferees focus on learning skills, knowhow and the Toyota Way throughout their training period, which is from six months to three years. Executives are posted as general managers or department managers at TMC to learn about decision-making processes and to be connected with other employees.
 
TQM (Total Quality Management)

TQM is a management initiative that puts into practice the principles of “Customer First,” “kaizen (continuous improvement),” and “every member participating.” Its goal is to create a culture of employees challenging themselves to institute reforms and achieve human resource development that draws out creativity. As measures to implement it, Toyota is actively carrying out QC circle activities* and the Creative Suggestion System. QC circle activities in particular have also been deployed to affiliates overseas, with more than 100,000 participants involved in approximately 16,000 circles every year.
* QC circle activities: The circles are formed mainly by employees in shop floor jobs, who actively engage in activities to identify and solve on-the-job problems. When carrying out activities, all circle members strive to make continuous improvements on their own initiative, with the determination to promote individual growth and improve the workplace together. As a result, teamwork and trust are developed, and a positive and fulfilling workplace is created.

Diversity and Inclusion
 

Promoting Women’s Participation in the Workplace (Japan)
 

 


   Fundamental Approach	

Toyota’s strengths lie in our capacity to respect our employees’ abilities to think and promote reforms involving every member.
Recent technical innovations centered on CASE are propelling Toyota to transform from a car company into a mobility company. We believe such a transformation is becoming increasingly important as we are expected to continue creating innovations steadily in existing areas while taking on challenges in new areas.
In such an environment, Toyota considers diversity and inclusion to be one of the key bases of management, and we are working to create an attractive workplace where employees with wide-ranging skills and values can demonstrate their abilities to the fullest and achieve self-realization.
In order to become a company that will be needed and chosen by society, we are promoting collaboration with a wide variety of partners both inside and outside the company while putting into practice the values Toyota has embraced since its founding, such as the attitude of humbly learning and taking on challenges from the customer’s viewpoint.

Global Promotion Structure
We are implementing measures appropriate to individual regions globally throughout the entire Toyota Group. In particular, we have set up a dedicated diversity and inclusion promotion organization in the Head Office in Japan, TMNA (U.S.), TMCA (Australia), and TSAM (South Africa). Furthermore, in many regions, we have established diversity and inclusion promotion organizations consisting mainly of concurrent appointments within the area of human resources.

Diversity promotion members from various countries
 
In promoting diversity and inclusion, we recognize that gender diversity has been an issue, particularly at the Head Office in Japan. In 2002, we started initiatives at the Head Office centered on expanding and establishing measures to support women who are trying to balance work and childcare. Then in 2012, we began focusing on initiatives for creating a work environment that would help women gain motivation and supporting their participation (especially development of female managers).

[Support Measures for Balancing Work and Childcare]
For those planning to take maternity leave, we have been offering Pre-maternity Leave Seminars and Supervisor Career Interviews since 2015. The goals of these events are to ease the participants’ concerns about balancing work and childcare and to raise the level of desire to continue growing after returning to work, as well. The participants evaluate their career plans and how best to achieve them, hear about other employees who successfully balanced work with family in the past, and participate in roundtable discussions.

[Career Development Support Measures]
In 2019, we introduced a career workshop targeting female employees and their supervisors. We are supporting the continued growth of female employees through various measures, including supporting
long-term career building with life events taken into consideration, providing advice to supervisors on how to guide their subordinates, and facilitating dialogues between supervisors and subordinates. Additionally, in 2005, we introduced the career return system, which provides re-employment opportunities to employees who are forced to leave Toyota due to job-related relocation of their spouse (regardless of the spouse’s gender or whether the spouse is a Toyota employee) or the need to provide nursing care. Then in 2019, we expanded the system and introduced the career continuation support system for Toyota employees who are moving overseas due to their spouse’s overseas relocation. By providing a structure enabling Toyota employees to continue their careers at the overseas relocation destinations of their spouses, we are helping our female employees develop long-term careers and promoting excellent performance.

Initiatives Related to Persons with Disabilities

●	Initiatives in Japan
Based on the concept of harmonious society, in which all persons with or without disabilities work and live together in harmony, we provide various work opportunities to those with disabilities. We offer a variety of support to enable persons with disabilities to work energetically by fully utilizing their abilities.
For example, we have assigned a job consultant to each office, created a consultation hotline that ensures privacy, and introduced a special holiday system that can be used by employees for going to hospital or other clinics. Furthermore, to ensure that persons with disabilities are given fair opportunities, we send in sign language interpreters, provide a variety of support tools, and make workplace improvements as needed. In terms of facility, we are creating workplaces with improved accessibility as needed by for example providing handicapped parking spaces and universally accessible toilets.
To those workplaces hiring employees with disabilities, we are distributing guidebooks to help other employees better understand disabilities and gain the knowledge necessary for providing support. In addition, to cultivate a workplace-wide culture, we have implemented Emotional Barrier-free Training targeting a wide range of employees, from new employees to senior professional/senior management, to promote understanding of and empathy for people with disabilities.
As of June 2019, the number of persons with disabilities employed was 1,322 accounting for 2.33 percent of the entire workforce (including special-purpose subsidiaries) which is above the legal requirement of 2.2 percent.

Creating an Environment Where the Disabled Can Work with Assurance
Toyota Loops Corporation began operation in April 2009 with 28 people with disabilities and received certification from the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare as a special-purpose subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation in October of that year.
Toyota Loops primarily handles work that is outsourced from Toyota such as internal printing, mail services, enclosing catalogues and document digitization. It also performs a variety of office support tasks such as issuing visitor and employee identification cards, and shredding documents, as well as erasing data from unneeded PCs. The company is also providing nursing assistance at Toyota Memorial Hospital and healthcare services (massage) that can be used by Toyota employees.
As of June 2019, Toyota Loops employed 256 persons with disabilities. The number of support staff has also been increased in order to eliminate or reduce anxieties that employees may have regarding their health or work. We are also reinforcing support by creating a consultation hotline and providing consultations with an industrial physician and counseling by a clinical psychologist and psychiatrist.
We actively exchange information with governmental bodies, local communities, and social welfare organizations to create working environments where each employee can work with reassurance. We also have many employees who are active outside work.
Toyota Loops employees representing Aichi Prefecture participated in the Abilympics (a national technical skills competition for persons with disabilities) in Okinawa Prefecture held in November 2018, winning silver in the Database division and bronze in the Word Processor division.

Toyota Loops Employees Support Toyota Memorial Hospital

Starting in November 2014, 10 Toyota Loops employees have been providing business support in the field of medicine. They provide support work for nursing assistants in five wings of the Toyota Memorial Hospital (ER, Internal Mixed, Orthopedics, Surgery Mixed, Stroke Center). Starting with preparing tea or moist towels for the patients, they make beds, check laundry for cleaning, and other jobs.
The nursing assistants note that “although it was hard for them to learn the work at first, now they do their work very diligently and carefully. This gives us more time with our patients and helps us provide better service.”

●	Global Initiatives
We are striving to create a workplace environment that is friendly even to employees with disabilities by, for example, providing universally accessible toilets, handicapped parking spaces, and wheelchair ramps. We also conduct a variety of events, for example participating in campaigns and holding workshops, to promote understanding about people with disabilities.

[TDEM (Thailand)]
Together with organizations serving people with disabilities, we are carrying out activities to promote safe driving, such as holding seminars with the goal of increasing knowledge and awareness about safe driving.

LGBT-related Initiatives

●	Initiatives in Japan
Toyota has launched initiatives with the aim of creating workplaces with an appropriate understanding and acceptance of LGBT people.
Prohibition on discrimination or harassment of LGBT people has been incorporated into the employee behavioral guidelines, and we no longer require new graduates to fill in their sex on their job application sheets.
In our company training, we provide training to enlighten new graduate employees about human rights, and we also provide experience-based training by outside instructors (LGBT people) for mid-career employees. Furthermore, Toyota has established an internal harassment consultation hotline, and is making dedicated toilets for LGBT people in Head Office and Nagoya office.
●	Global Initiatives
[TMNA (U.S.)]
During the recruiting and hiring process, we provide a non-discrimination statement to everyone that submits a job application. That statement says that the company does not discriminate based on gender, ethnicity, and many other categories, including LGBT. We do not require a photo or gender identification on resumes. One of our business partner groups (organizations representing minority’s interest) is an LGBT group.

Major Initiatives of Nursing Care (Japan)

As nursing care environments change, we have been expanding company measures on nursing care since 2009, in order to reduce employee burdens and anxiety, allowing them to devote themselves to work. For example, we hold lectures by outside experts such as licensed social welfare workers and nursing care workers since 2009.
 

Based on the revisions to the Law on Stabilization of Employment of Elderly Persons in 2006 and 2013, the support was revised to expand re-employment by taking surveys and interviews based on the needs of the employees.
In addition, starting from 2016, the Advanced Skilled Partner System was set up for shop floor employees to encourage and motivate employees to retire at 65 years old by maintaining their job rank and salary.

Employment for Over-60s (Japan)

Following the introduction of the Internal Re-employment Program for Retired Professionals in 1991, an Optional Re-employment Application System was launched in 2001 to outplace applicants to external affiliates and other sites, providing a framework for helping over-60s to continue working.
 
Employment of Fixed-term Contract Employees (Japan)

When hiring fixed-term contract employees, we ensure appropriate hiring and contract renewals, and also provide support for obtaining government certification to those who have fulfilled contracts exceeding one year, focusing maximum efforts on maintaining stable employment and improving their work capacity. With the full-time staff appointment system, fixed-term contract employees who have worked for TMC for at least one year have the chance to take an examination for employment by recommendation from their workplace. This leads to increased motivation and vitality. Fixed-term contract employees are also given the opportunity in their third year.
It is necessary to maintain strong workplace in order to achieve sustainable growth, and to this end, TMC continues to hire fixed-term contract employees as full-time employees.


Localization of Management at Overseas Facilities

Toyota is localizing management at overseas affiliates from a medium- to long-term perspective. The roles are defined so that the head office determines what needs to be done, and overseas affiliates decide how they will carry out those tasks. In principle, executives and chief officers responsible for overseas operations live at the respective overseas locations and create management systems close to operation.
Toyota also actively hires local employees. Of six regional headquarters, two are currently headed by
non-Japanese chief officers. As of April 2019, TMC has five non-Japanese executives (one of whom is an outside director).
We are working towards the localization of management posts as well. This should facilitate the timely understanding of customer and employee needs in each region, enabling us to make appropriate business decisions.

Special Olympics Initiative	The Role of Robots in Achieving Mobility for All

 
The Special Olympics (SO) is an international sports organization supporting people with intellectual disabilities to take part in society, providing various sports training opportunities, and holding events and competitions that give them opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. The Special Olympics provides training and athletic competition, giving athletes continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in the sharing of gifts, skills and friendship with other athletes, their families, and the community. Agreeing with this mission, Toyota is providing a variety of types of support, such as vehicles and volunteers, in order to help realize a society rich in diversity.
Toyota entered into an agreement to become a “National Partner” with the Special Olympics Nippon (SON) in January 2016.
In November 2017, Toyota entered into an agreement with Special Olympics International to become a Global Gold Partner. In addition, Toyota has agreed to support Special Olympics Unified Sports, which joins people with and without intellectual disabilities on the same team. Toyota was inspired by a simple principle: training together and playing together is a quick path to friendship and understanding. Beginning in 2018, Toyota has been supporting Special Olympics Unified Sports programming primarily in Japan and the United States.

Signing ceremony
 
At Toyota, we use industrial robot technology for a variety of applications based on our dedication to “Supporting human life activities and living in harmony with people.” Since 2004, we have developed partner robots focused on support for people unable to move on their own, including the aging population. Now, as we transform into a mobility company, we are expanding our robotics efforts to provide all people with the freedom to move. For Toyota, “Mobility for All” includes not only “physical” movement, but also people’s “virtual” mobility, which provides further opportunities to be “moved” emotionally.
Toyota is working to create new values that will support all customers’ desire to move and the “Mobility for All” that will make such dreams come true.
 
Expanding the Development Community through Supplying Human Support Robots (HSR)
Life support robot, Human Support Robot (HSR), is a compact robot intended to support customers’ daily lives. For example, HSR can pick up and carry objects and the user can remotely control or converse via the Internet.
Starting in 2015, we supplied HSRs to universities and research institutes as platforms, forming a development community that promotes sharing results and mutual use. Up to now, HSR has been used in research and development at 49 organizations in 13 countries including Japan. One of the organizations, Preferred Networks, Inc. (PFN) and Toyota have agreed in the summer of 2019 to engage in joint research and development on HSR robotics platform. The two companies aim to develop service robots that cater to market needs at the earliest opportunity.
We will also provide HSR as a platform in the household task support event at the World Robot Summit 2020.

Welwalk Rehabilitation Assist Robot
The Welwalk is designed to support rehabilitation such as walking training for people with lower limb paralysis due to strokes, etc. It features a range of rehabilitation support functions based on exercise learning theory, including an adjustment function that sets the movement level according to the patient’s ability, as well as a function to provide feedback regarding the patient’s gait characteristics.
In the autumn of 2017, we began a rental business for the Welwalk WW-1000 aimed at medical institutions, and rented out 75 units as of the end of July 2019. Then in June 2019, we announced the new technology which is scheduled to be installed on future Welwalk at an international academic conference on rehabilitation. The aim is for this design to be used in a more appropriate way at more facilities, for example by automatically detecting the patient’s abnormal gait on a real-time basis and displaying the recommended assistance setting values. A game function based on exercise learning theory is under development to improve the patient’s motivation for walking training.

June 2019, announced new technology planned to be introduced in future Welwalk
 

Toyota Robots to Help People Experience Their Dream of Attending the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020
Toyota, as a worldwide partner of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, aims to provide mobility solutions that go beyond providing official vehicles for the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 (Tokyo 2020).
For example, through robot-based communication and remote control, Toyota aims to enable customers at remote locations to interact with athletes and virtually experience the atmosphere of the event, as well as to use Field Support Robots to help operational staff achieve efficient operation of the event. Toyota will also provide Human Support Robots to help wheelchair-bound customers feel secure while they enjoy watching the games.
By actualizing dreams and delivering excitement through provision of robots that support all customers’ desire to move, Toyota is committed to make Tokyo 2020 a great success.

Assisted Mobility Vehicles	Agriculture and Biotechnology Business

 
As Japan enters into a period of a super-aging society, government policy is shifting towards home-based medical treatment and nursing care. As a result, there is a growing need for assisted mobility that is easy to use at home. Toyota named its assisted mobility vehicles Welcab with the hope of contributing to the happy lives of customers.
Our goal is to make vehicles that are comfortable and safe as well as simple and easy-to-use, and that give people with disabilities and the elderly the freedom of mobility, while also accommodating the needs and wants of caregivers.

Organization and Structure
We plan and develop Welcab vehicles based on five development perspectives—ease of getting in and out of the vehicle, comfortable and smooth ride, ease of operation for drivers and caregivers, ease of communication inside the vehicle, and reasonable pricing—while pursuing market needs.
Customers can experience Welcab vehicles firsthand at Welcab stations established at dealers and Heartful Plazas, which are general Welcab exhibit sites, with Welcab consultants onsite to help customers choose the most appropriate vehicle.
As of May 2018, there are 242 Welcab Stations and nine Heartful Plazas in Japan.

To contribute to solving global problems such as global warming, energy issues and food shortages, Toyota believes in the need for new businesses that contribute to the environment, in addition to the automotive business. Therefore, we are establishing a structure to carry out R&D in a variety of fields and start new businesses.

Support to Agricultural and Food Production Industries
We are pursuing various ways of applying our automotive production management and process improvement know-how to address issues faced by agriculture, such as the aging of the farming population and declining food self-sufficiency. One example is the Housaku-Keikaku agricultural IT management tool launched by Toyota in 2014 as a cloud-based solutions service that adopts the principles of the Toyota Production System to improve agricultural efficiency.
In March 2019, we began field trials of a new support service that uses data from real-time visualization of soil components during agricultural land analysis to diagnose soil characteristics and propose improvements. The aim of this service is to rapidly identify variations in soil components within a tract of agricultural land, and to help improve agricultural productivity and lower environmental impacts by enabling precise soil cultivation through waste-free addition of fertilizers and other soil improvement agents. This field trial is being carried out on farmland in Mie Prefecture in cooperation with Tokai Trading Co., Ltd., which has a wide range of know- how related to agricultural machinery and fertilizers, as well as extensive contacts in the farming industry.

Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050
—Going Beyond Zero Environmental Impact and Achieving a Net Positive Impact

We have formulated the Toyota Earth Charter based on the Guiding Principles at Toyota, considering environmental issues as a paramount importance, and have established its promotion structure to address such issues. In the course of perceiving public opinions or world trends and while considering our focus in the years to come, Toyota is working on this problem with new ideas and technologies ahead of future challenges. In October 2015, we formulated six challenges based on piles of environmental issues and we have been moving ahead, aiming to establish a future society in harmony with nature.

Six Environmental Challenges to Be Achieved by Toyota Toward 2050
 

Processes to Identify and Implement the Key Challenges (Materiality)

Environmental challenges may involve both business risks and opportunities. It is therefore essential to identify key challenges (materiality) from both risk and opportunity perspectives when formulating a long- term vision. In order to grasp the potential risks and business opportunities, Toyota has collected information, analyzing and identifying environmental challenges from the standpoints of the degree of relevance to stakeholder and the importance for our business.


Organize Medium- to Long-term Issues Based on the Business Environment
We examined a wide range of global trends in collecting and analyzing information. These include scientific predictions for the environment in 2050, global frameworks and policy trends, development in emerging countries, major index from external rating agencies, and world leaders’ remarks on environmental issues at G7 Summits. This broad examination provided us with an understanding of macroeconomic trends and important needs of societies, enabling us to organize candidate challenges.
 

Extract Key Challenges (Materiality)
From the candidate challenges organized in Step 1, we extracted challenges that need to be addressed based on analyses of external affairs obtained through key indicators of ESG investors and research institutions, and communication with stakeholders including international organizations, NGOs, and consumers, while the analyses of internal affairs is based on the Guiding Principles at Toyota, the Toyota Earth Charter, and discussions among concerned internal divisions.

Evaluate and Identify Key Challenges (Materiality)
We conducted two-axis mapping of the challenges extracted in Step 2 from the perspectives of the level of relevance to stakeholders and the risks and potential for creation of new business within Toyota’s business activities and prioritized them.

 

Toyota is contributing to achieving the goals and targets of the SDGs* through measures to realize the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050. On the first page of each challenge, relevant goals and targets of the SDGs are described together with action plans and goals of the sixth Toyota Environmental Action Plan for achieving the SDGs.
* Sustainable Development Goals: International goals for the period from 2016 to 2030 set forth in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015. The SDGs consists of 17 goals and 169 targets.
 
Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 Formulation, Regular Review of Action Plans, and Information Disclosures
We formulated challenges that are of high relevance to stakeholders and are priorities for Toyota as the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 (Six Challenges) and approved by the Corporate Planning Meeting (current "Sustainability Meeting"), which deliberates on Toyota's medium- to long-term strategies. Steady implementation of our challenges requires top management's recognition of environmental initiatives as potential business opportunities and make effective investments, in addition to involving Toyota Group companies as well as strengthening collaboration with our business partners. Accordingly, we will review and evaluate our action plans on a regular basis.

Think About the Climate Change Effects in 2030 Using Scenario Analysis

 
The Scenario Analysis Process	STEP 1 Set Future Images Assuming Climate Change
 
Future Image in 2030
 
To confirm that the 2030 Milestone is a valid and resilient strategy for addressing the effects that climate change will have on Toyota, we conducted scenario analysis by picturing multiple future images in 2030.
The climate scenarios mentioned above were developed by referencing scenarios equivalent to “2°C (2DS)” and “Beyond 2°C (B2DS)” in the International Energy Agency (IEA) reports and others.


Set Future Images Assuming Climate Change Effects


We pictured multiple images of the automobile industry and the mobility society in 2030, by referencing the IEA scenarios and assuming climate change effects.

Consider the Impacts on Toyota
We considered what impacts each of the future images as of 2030 will have on Toyota’s business strategies and finances.


Confirm Measures under 2030 Milestone
Based on the impacts that Toyota will have, we confirmed that the 2030 Milestone has sufficient resilience under different climate change scenarios.
 
Effects
As climate change measures proceeds, there is a possibility that the automobile industry and the entire mobility society will be exposed to substantial changes such as stricter policies including fuel efficiency regulations and the introduction of and increases in carbon pricing as well as advances in technology, and changes in customer awareness. In light of these climate change effects, based on the IEA scenarios and others, we developed multiple future images of 2030 as the external environment that will surround Toyota. With regard to the IEA scenarios, we put focus on the 2°C scenario (2DS) and pictured future images in cases where climate change measures do not progress and where climate change measures progress further (B2DS).

STEP 2 Consider the Impacts on Toyota

We considered the impacts on Toyota for each of the future images developed in STEP 1.
No matter what type of society develops in 2030, the global market for the new vehicles will expand, but in a society where climate change measures proceeds further, it is believed that changes to business models will accelerate as a result of sharing and others.
We believe that in such a society, it will be possible to expand CO2 reduction effects as a result of the use of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and other electrified vehicles including ZEVs in sharing businesses, which
are expected to have higher utilization rates compared to private ownership of vehicles. This in turn will lead to increased business opportunities.
With regard to effects on production and purchasing, introduction of and increases in carbon pricing is anticipated in accordance with the global advance of climate change measures, leading to the possibility of
higher purchasing and production costs.
 

Specific measures relating to electrified vehicle sales targets include the announcement that the projection for achieving the electrified vehicle sales target in the 2030 Milestone has been moved up by approximately five years. Also, Toyota invested in Uber which develops a large sharing business in North America, and is steadily proceeding correspondence to the development of new mobility business including developing automated driving ridesharing.

The percentages of electrified vehicles and ZEVs in global sales of new vehicles vary considerably depending on the scenario, and in anticipation of these circumstances, it will be important to flexibly consider powertrain lineups and development of mobility businesses.
Under the 2030 Milestone, the percentage of ZEVs will exceed the 2DS level, but will not reach the level necessary to achieve B2DS. However, through the development of HEVs, Toyota has been establishing a mass production base by cultivating the component technologies essential to electrified vehicles. These technologies can also be utilized in ZEVs, and Toyota is capable of making flexible and strategic changes to powertrain lineups according to demand changes. Therefore, Toyota will be able to respond to changes in social demand through advances in its electrified vehicle technologies.
 
With regard to the effects on purchasing and production as a result of the introduction of and increases in carbon pricing, we determined that we will be able to respond to the risks of cost increases by steadily implementing initiatives under Challenges 2 and 3.
Going forward, we will continuously confirm that initiatives are adequate based on the progress of Challenges 2 and 3 while confirming trends relating to carbon pricing.
Furthermore, in the case where climate change measures throughout society are not adequate, there may be negative effects on production and purchasing as a result of natural disasters, but we will contribute to climate change measures through our environmental challenge initiatives and consider means of minimizing the impacts on purchasing and production from climate change.
With regard to the ongoing confirmations of the suitability and progress of the 2030 Milestone, we believe that we will have opportunities for stable funding and increase corporate value by enhancing responses to dialogues with institutional investors and other stakeholders as well as various ESG evaluation indicators through appropriate information disclosures.

Summary: FY2019 Review of the Sixth Toyota Environmental Action Plan

Area	FY2019 Results Overview

 
Low Carbon
(Climate Change, CO2)
 
Challenge 1: By improving environmental performance and expanding vehicle lineups, we reduced global average CO2 emissions from new vehicles during operation by 14.9 percent compared to 2010. We sold
1.63 million hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) globally, surpassing our target (1.5 million units per year). Additionally, we began selling two plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) models in China, and premiered the
CH-R and IZOA battery electric vehicle (BEV) models, planned for launch in 2020, at Auto Shanghai. As for fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), we enhanced our production facility in preparation for increased sales.
 


Challenge 2: In the area of product development, we conducted life cycle assessment using Eco-VAS of six vehicle models sold in Japan. In all models, we achieved CO2 emission levels equivalent to or lower than those of reference vehicles. In the area of logistics, we reduced CO2 emissions through steady kaizen activities (loading efficiency improvement, shortening of logistics routes, and modal shifts).

Challenge 3: To reduce CO2 emissions in production, we continued to introduce innovative production technologies into processes that consume a lot of energy, such as painting processes. Furthermore, we are expanding reduction effects globally through yokoten of measures especially on adoption of steamless and airless processes and on a shift to LED lighting, as well as best practices in daily kaizen activities. We also accelerated global introduction of renewable energy, especially with the goal of achieving 100 percent usage in 2019 in Europe and 2020 in South America.

 
Recycling
(Resources, Water)
 
Challenge 4: To reduce water usage, we comprehensively promoted introduction of reduction technologies and daily water-saving efforts, such as water recycling and reducing the amount of steam used in painting processes. At Challenge-focus plants on reducing water usage, we formulated activity road maps toward the next Environmental Action Plan and began taking actions proactively.
 

Challenge 5: In the area of resource recycling, we set up a model facility for properly processing End-of-life vehicles in Vietnam. We also prepared a video manual on large lithium-ion battery removal for PHEVs and distributed it to countries where we have been selling HEVs. In addition, we established battery 3R promotion organizations in four regions (North America, Europe, China, and Asia). In order to further promote plastic recycling, we began studying ways to utilize more recycled plastic first in Europe where the recycled plastic market is large. In the area of production, we are continuing to implement daily waste-reduction measures, such as converting grinding dust into a valuable material by reducing its water content. In the area of logistics, we introduced simplified and returnable packaging and wrapping materials, steadily reducing the waste generated and the material used in packaging and wrapping.

 
Harmony with Nature
 
Challenge 6: In the Toyota Green Wave Project, as the first step of the Plant in Harmony with Nature, we opened a new biotope at the Tsutsumi Plant under cooperation from the local residents and experts, and established an activity structure based on an indicator species survey. In the Toyota Today for Tomorrow Project, we continued collaboration toward biodiversity conservation by jointly hosting a side event with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) at an UN conference, and donating vehicles to NGOs involved in survey and conservation initiatives for endangered species. In the Toyota ESD Project, in addition to activities in the existing Toyota Global Environment Month, we introduced a new internal education campaign featuring wildlife and water with the aim of enhancing employee awareness about the environment.
 

 
Management
 
Environmental Management: Six minor environmental non-compliance issues occurred. In response to these incidents, we developed preventive measures and implemented comprehensive yokoten of these measures. In the area of sales and service, we created and distributed an Environmental Guidebook to dealers in Japan. We also strengthened our environmental initiatives overseas based on regional environmental guidelines.
Toyota’s Environmental Report 2018 won the Grand Prize in the Environmental Reporting Category at the 22nd Environmental Communication Awards. The investigation of climate-related risks and opportunities based on the 2°C and beyond 2°C scenarios, the logic of the 2030 Milestone to realize the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, and other elements were highly evaluated.

Challenge 1	New Vehicle Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge
 

Promoting Development of Next-generation Vehicles Using Electric Power, and Widespread Use According to Their Features
 

 
   Fundamental Approach	
 
In order to curb greenhouse gases, we believe that effective vehicle electrification is essential for the efficient use of energy, and
 
Extreme weather phenomena around the world are wreaking havoc on society, attesting to the reality of global warming. If adequate measures are not taken, the harm will become even more severe, and the risks of global-scale damage have been pointed out. Under these circumstances, the Paris Agreement, which came into effect in 2016, sets long-term goals to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above
pre-industrial levels.
As the world is moving toward the realization of the beyond 2°C scenario, Toyota sees this situation as both a risk and an opportunity and announced the “New Vehicle Zero CO2 Challenge.” Toyota will strive to slash average CO2 emissions per vehicle by 90 percent in comparison with 2010 levels, by 2050.
 
Based on the idea that eco-friendly vehicles contribute to society only when they come into widespread use, we are not only deploying technologies for conventional engine vehicles, but also accelerating advances in technology and its widespread adoption for the electrified vehicles that Toyota has been developing (including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs)).
Toyota is committed to continue working hand in hand with stakeholders to build the necessary infrastructure that supports the widespread adoption of these vehicles.
Through these initiatives, we will contribute to achieving SDG 7.3 (improvement in energy efficiency) and 13.1 (reduction of CO2).

encouraging the use of alternative fuels. Since the launch of the Prius, a pioneering electrified vehicle, Toyota has taken the initiative in developing and promoting the widespread use of electrified vehicles based on the belief that eco-friendly vehicles can contribute to the environment only when they come into widespread use.
In December 2017, we announced the challenges toward the popularization of electrified vehicles, which is one of the medium- to long-term initiatives. We aim to achieve global sales of more than 5.5 million electrified vehicles including more than 1 million BEVs and FCEVs, which are ZEVs*, by 2030. We will expand dedicated electrified models and electric options through about 2025 and will have no vehicles available only as an engine model globally.
Starting in 2020, we will accelerate the introduction of BEVs, initially in China, and will expand BEV models to more than 10 in the first half of the decade worldwide.
We will also expand the lineup of FCEVs and PHEVs throughout the 2020s. With regard to HEVs, we will raise the efficiency of the 2.0-liter Toyota Hybrid System (THS II) while developing various types of hybrid systems such as high-power and simplified versions, expanding the product line-up to meet customer needs.

Accelerating the Widespread Use of Electrified Vehicles (China)
Toyota is reinforcing local development and production systems for electrified vehicle powertrains in China to accelerate the electrification of vehicles.
In April 2019, Toyota premiered the C-HR and IZOA BEV models at Auto Shanghai in China. The C-HR and IZOA BEV models will be the first Toyota brand BEVs to launch in China. Sales are slated to start from 2020.
Also, Toyota’s other booth exhibited a variety of electrified vehicles, such as HEV variants for the RAV4 and the Alphard/Vellfire, as well as the Corolla/Levin PHEV models, and the RHOMBUS, a BEV concept car.
Sales of the Corolla and Levin PHEV models started in March 2019. And, by further promoting local production of electric motors, batteries, inverters, and other electrified vehicle core technologies, Toyota aims to further accelerate its vehicle electrification efforts.
As for FCEVs, Toyota has been conducting verification tests with the MIRAI since 2017, and is considering the local introduction of other fuel cell vehicles such as the FC Coaster.
 
Grant Royalty-Free Licenses for Vehicle Electrification Technology Accumulated Through HEV Development
Since 2015, Toyota granted royalty-free licenses based on their belief that it is important to give priority to spurring more widespread use of FCEVs, and therefore believed concerted initiatives with energy companies that are looking to expand hydrogen station infrastructure, and automobile manufacturers that are looking to move forward with FCEV development and market introduction, will be vital.
In April 2019, Toyota decided to grant royalty-free licenses (Toyota holds approximately 23,740 patents worldwide including pending applications) for vehicle electrification-related technologies such as motors, power control units (PCUs), and system controls as a part of its initiative to promote the widespread use of electrified vehicles.
Toyota will also provide technical support to other manufacturers developing and manufacturing electrified vehicles when they utilize Toyota’s powertrain systems.
Toyota believes that this new initiative will spur the development and market launch of electrified vehicles globally, contributing to curb global warming by reducing CO2 emissions.

To mitigate the various risks posed by climate change, the “Life Cycle Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge” seeks to completely eliminate CO2 emissions not only while driving vehicles, but throughout the entire vehicle life cycle including materials and parts manufacturing and vehicle assembly, maintenance, disposal, and recycling.
Some electrified vehicles may have materials and parts that increase CO2 emissions in the processes of manufacturing. Possible means of reducing this include adopting low CO2 emitting materials during manufacturing as well as reducing material usage and the number of
 
parts used. It is possible to reduce CO2 emissions in the disposal and recycling stages by expanding use of recycled materials and designs that make it easier to dismantle vehicles.
We will accelerate eco-friendly designs as we pursue “ever-better cars.” We will also promote reductions in CO2 through the efficient use of mobility by providing mobility services and supporting the widespread adoption of eco-driving.
Through these initiatives, we will contribute to achieving SDG 12.8 (sustainable lifestyle) and 13.1 (reduction of CO2).

Response to Scope 3
Scope 3 is a standard established to measure CO2 emissions at all stages of a company’s business activities and identify areas for future reductions. Scope 3 accounts for not only CO2 emissions from their activities and those of their consolidated subsidiaries (Scope 1 and Scope 2), but emissions from other stages of the life cycle, such as procured materials and parts, transportation, employee commuting and business travel, along with the driving, maintenance, and disposal of customer vehicles.
The calculation results for FY2019 are overall Scope 3 CO2 emissions of 414.91 million tons-CO2, with category 1 and category 11 combined accounting for the bulk of the total, approximately 97 percent. Category 1 covers emissions from materials and parts at the manufacturing stage, while category 11 covers emissions from vehicles driven by customers. Therefore, use of lightweight parts, materials selection, development of fuel efficiency improvement technologies, and next-generation eco-friendly vehicles are important measures that will lead to CO2 emissions reduction.
Moving forward, we will continue to monitor Scope 3 emissions and utilize the findings to take measures for developing technologies.
 

 

Eco-Driving Supported Through Diagnosis of Driving Tendencies and the Provision of Advice by the Car
The Corolla Sport is a connected car that comes with data communication modules as standard on all grades. By linking the vehicle with the Toyota Smart Center, drivers can receive 24-hour support, and by equipping the T-Connect navigation system, enhanced services can be used. MyTOYOTA for T-Connect is an application used to coordinate with Toyota vehicles equipped with T-Connect/G-BOOK to check the status and driving data of the registered vehicle. The driving diagnosis function makes automatic diagnoses based on customer’s driving tendencies, and displays the results from the perspectives of safe driving and eco-driving.
Eco-driving is numerically scored based on four items: accelerator work, brake work, speed maintenance, and idling. Monthly reports provide driving advice and indicate fuel efficiency rankings among users in Japan.

Pursuing Transportation Efficiency and Reducing CO2 Emissions in Logistics Activities

To reduce CO2 emissions in its logistics activities, Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) is taking measures to improve the transportation efficiency of production parts, completed vehicles, and spare parts.
In FY2019, we continued fuel efficiency initiatives, including loading efficiency improvement, shortening logistics routes, modal shifts, and so on, maintaining CO2 emissions per unit of workload (transportation volume) at 104.2 g-CO2/tkm (same as the previous year).
CO2 emissions from logistics operations totaled 0.289 million tons (up 1.0 percent year on year), due largely to an increase in volume in Japan.
At the global level, Toyota began assessing CO2 emissions in each country and region in FY2008, and indicated global target guidelines starting in FY2014. Based on these guidelines, each country and region set a goal toward which they have been carrying out reduction activities.
As a result, Toyota’s global CO2 emissions in FY2019 totaled 2.20 million tons. We will make a full analysis of results and continuously strive to further improve transportation efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions per transportation volume.

Reduction in CO2 Emissions by Changing the Structure of Kyushu Route	CO2 Emissions Reduction Through Joint Transportation (Vietnam)

 
For logistics to Kyushu, engines produced at the Kamigo Plant and Shimoyama Plant in the Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) Honsha region were transported overland by truck to the Toyota Motor Kyushu, Inc. (TMK) Miyata Plant, but empty pallets were transported on the return trip. Moreover, engines and transaxles produced at TMK’s Kanda Plant and Kokura Plant were transported to various TMC plants, and similarly, empty pallets were transported on the return trips.
By focusing on these two examples and reducing the total number of trips made by both companies, CO2 during transportation was reduced. In addition, previously all transportation was made by truck, but by implementing a modal shift to railway transportation between the Nagoya Minami Terminal and the Kitakyushu Terminal, CO2 during transportation was reduced even further. Furthermore, the folding effects of pallets were utilized to reduce the total number of transportation trucks from 18 to 13 per day.
As a result of these measures, CO2 emissions were reduced from 10,052 tons-CO2 per year to 1,495 tons-CO2 per year.
 
TMV, a Vietnam-based affiliate, produces the Corolla, Camry, and other vehicles. Many production parts are transported from overseas by ship and then transported by truck from the port in Vietnam to TMV. Conversely, the completed vehicles produced by TMV are transported by truck to the port and then sent overseas by ship. The number of transportation trucks to transport the parts is greater than that of completed vehicles, resulting in empty space on trucks from TMV to the port.
Meanwhile, Canon Inc. has a nearby plant. Unlike TMV, Canon has few imports but a large volume of exports, and as a result, has empty space on trucks going from the port to the plant. By adjusting their trucking schedules and transporting each other’s products in the empty space, TMV and Canon were both able to reduce the number of transportation trucks and cut CO2 emissions.
As a result of these measures, the distance travelled by trucks was reduced from 205,590 km to 174,630 km per month and monthly CO2 emissions fell from 125 tons to 106 tons, a reduction of about 15 percent.

Challenge 3	Plant Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge

   Fundamental Approach	
 

Reduce CO2 Emissions in Production Activities

Introduction of Innovative Technologies and Daily Kaizen
In our production activities, we have been developing and introducing low-CO2 production technologies along with taking daily improvement measures to achieve our reduction targets.
 
The Plant Zero CO2 Emissions Challenge seeks zero CO2 emissions in the vehicle manufacturing process. To achieve this, Toyota will work on both the introduction of innovative technologies and daily kaizen and the introduction of renewable energy and utilization of hydrogen.
First of all, processes and the time required were reduced by simplifying and streamlining manufacturing processes, which made an improvement to energy use efficiency, including equipment optimization and the use of waste heat. Furthermore, we use every possible means to reduce CO2 emissions including introducing an

innovative process called karakuri that does not consume any energy source at all. In addition, we will effectively utilize renewable energy such as solar power and wind power along with hydrogen energy, and we are committed to continuing working hand in hand with stakeholders to build the necessary infrastructure to support the widespread use of these energy sources.
Through these initiatives, we will contribute to achieving SDG 7.2 (introduction of renewable energy), 7.3 (improvement in energy efficiency), 9.1 (infrastructure development), 9.4 (sustainable production processes), and 13.1 (reduction of CO2).

 	 	 















 
In FY2019, Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) plant manufacturing divisions worked with production engineering and drive force personnel to conduct energy diagnoses at production sites, propose improvements, implement measures, and undertake energy-saving activities (internal ESCO activities). In addition, TMC continuously undertook yokoten* of best practices.
Also, energy-saving effects were achieved by starting to introduce innovative technologies with a focus on painting processes as well as adopting steamless and airless processes and shifting to LED lighting. As a result, we reduced total CO2 emissions to 1.11 million tons (down 2.9 percent year on year), and CO2 emissions per unit produced to 0.387 tons (down 1.8 percent year on year).
Globally, there were some overseas affiliates with higher CO2 emissions as a result of increase in production volumes in conjunction with the installation of new production lines, but CO2 reductions were accelerated by adopting TMC best-practice in their own business operations. Affiliated companies in Japan conducted study sessions to share know-how on energy-saving activities with vehicle manufacturing companies and parts manufacturers, and that information was reflected in improvements at each company. We also observed other industries and worked to discover new ideas of kaizen. Moreover, CO2 emissions reduction effects were achieved by actively purchasing renewable energy from regions where an environment for the introduction of renewable energy has been developed, and by installing solar panels to generate in-house power for internal consumption. As a result of these measures, total CO2 emissions were
7.65 million tons (down 1.8 percent year on year), and CO2 emissions per unit produced were 0.712 tons (down 3.8 percent year on year).
In order to further reduce CO2 emissions from production activities, we will continue our energy-saving activities, such as internal ESCO activities and accelerate introduction of innovative technologies.

Introduction of Innovative Technologies in Painting Processes

Painting processes involve robots equipped with paint spray devices installed in large painting booths. The vicinity needs equipment such as air conditioning units for venting large volumes of air, and paint ovens. As a result, large amounts of CO2 are emitted.
To reduce CO2 emissions, attention was focused on cutting the amount of paint wasted by paint spray devices as a result of paint rebounding from vehicle bodies.
By switching to electrostatic adhesion technology that does not rely on the air used in the past, coating efficiency was increased 20 percent and the amount of air used was slashed by 75 percent. This also resulted in a reduction in the amount of ventilation. As a synergy effect of the improvement in coating efficiency and reduction in ventilation volume, the spray dust recovery method used in painting booths was changed from water recovery to absorption by dry filters, reducing water usage and waste, and cutting air conditioning energy use.
 
These innovative technologies were introduced at the Tsutsumi Plant, and
we plan to expand introduction at other plants including overseas plants.

Introduction of Renewable Energy and Utilization of Hydrogen
Toyota is promoting the introduction of renewable energy, taking into consideration the characteristics of each country and region.
When introducing renewable energy, we place the highest priority on in-house generating facilities (such as solar power generation) and in-house consumption at Toyota plants and other facilities.
In FY2019, we generated 39,528 MWh of renewable electricity globally.
* See “Effective Use of Renewable Energy for Creating a Decarbonized Society in 2050” (pp. 73–74) and “Toward Realizing a Decarbonized Society in 2050: Use of Hydrogen Energy” (pp. 70–72).
 
process. After implementation of this kaizen, the production line was inclined so that the doors move under their own weight. The incline angle was determined by conducting repeated trials to ensure that there is no impact on product quality during transportation. By having workers press on a pedal to lift the doors and transport them to the next line, the energy used by motors, cylinders, and so on has been reduced to zero. As a result of this kaizen, energy consumption per unit produced is down 0.065 kWh, annual energy consumption is down 12,082 kWh, and annual CO2 emissions have been reduced by 6,500 kg.

Challenge 4	Challenge of Minimizing and Optimizing Water Usage

   Fundamental Approach	
 

Measures Undertaken in Accordance with the Toyota Water Environment Policy
Although water-related issues and measures differ depending on the region, Toyota established the Toyota Water Environment Policy and takes action in order to achieve the goals of our water environment
 
According to forecasts, the world's population will grow to 9.1 billion by 2050, water demand will increase 55 percent from current levels, and 40 percent of the world’s population is therefore expected to suffer water shortages*.
Water problems such as increases in water stress in conjunction with rising populations and stricter regulations in response to deterioration of water quality in rivers and other water sources are important issues from the perspective of risks in corporate activities. Water is used in painting and other car manufacturing processes. This makes it imperative to reduce the impact on the water environment, to whatever degree possible.
There are significant differences in the characteristics of the water environment depending on the region, but we have two main
 
strategies: thoroughly reduce the amount of water usage and purify wastewater thoroughly and return. Toyota has implemented various initiatives such as collecting rainwater to reduce industrial water usage, cutting water usage in production processes, recycling wastewater to reduce amounts withdrawn from water sources, and returning high-quality water to local environments.
In the future, we will undertake measures that have a positive impact on local water environments, taking into consideration the local requests and water issues.
Through these initiatives, we will contribute to achieving SDG 6.3 (improve water quality) and 6.4 (secure water resources).
* According to Toyota data

Reduce Water Usage in Production Activities
 

 

Water Reduction by Using RO Wastewater (South Africa)
 

 
To reduce water usage in our production activities, we have been working to introduce innovative technologies alongside planned upgrades to our production lines, and to conduct daily measures to reduce water usage.
In FY2019, Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) continued measures such as reducing the amount of steam used in production processes. Total water usage was 10.1 million m3 (down 2.2 percent year on year). The production volume decreased, but a uniform amount of water is used regardless of the number of units, and consequently, water usage per unit produced was 4.1 m3 (up 4.4 percent year on year). Globally, Toyota is steadily implementing measures to reduce water usage according to the actual water environment in each country and region. Measures were implemented to recycle wastewater and more affiliates decreased their water usage.
However, as a result of an increase in the number of units produced due to the creation of new production lines and other factors, total water usage was 33.7 million m3 (up 2.3 percent year on year). Due to implementation of water quality measures, an increase in the number of washings, and other factors, water usage per unit produced was 3.2 m3 (up 0.4 percent year on year). Moving ahead, we will continue striving to minimize impacts on the water environment through the promotion of water-saving and water recycling.

Trends in Total Water Usage and Usage per Unit Produced at TMC
 
TSAM, a South Africa-based affiliate, reduced its water usage in the Body Paint Plant (an area that uses large volumes of water) by reusing the wastewater generated from the RO process*.
Prior to the change, TSAM used municipal water in the body washing process. Kaizen measures were implemented in accordance with policies to substantially reduce water usage and reuse wastewater to reduce water intake.
First, TSAM comprehensively investigated the flow rates, quality, and volumes of municipal water and wastewater generated to determine which processes could use recycled wastewater. The company also examined the risks associated with reusing wastewater. Based on the results, TSAM identified that it could reuse the wastewater generated from the RO process.
Municipal water and wastewater generated from the RO process differ only in their conductivity and are equivalent in other measures of water quality, indicating that the reuse of this wastewater would not present any problems. Based on this, TSAM decided to use recycled wastewater for the washing process prior to undercoat painting. As a result, usage of municipal water was reduced while maintaining the same high level of painting quality.
Due to this kaizen, water usage per unit produced was reduced by 23.6 liters, and annual water usage reduced by 3,285 m3.

Challenge 5	Challenge of Establishing a Recycling-based Society and Systems

   Fundamental Approach	
 
Reduce Consumption of Dwindling Natural Resources Through Utilization of Renewable Resources and Recycled Materials
Reduce the Usage of Petroleum-derived Plastics
Since the early 1990s, Toyota has been collecting and recycling
 
Due to global population increase along with the pressure for economic growth and convenient lifestyles, the pace of resource consumption is accelerating. If large-scale exploitation continues as it is, natural resources will be depleted, and if waste increases due to mass consumption, appropriate disposal will be unable to keep pace, resulting in risks of environmental pollution.
To prevent the environmental impact caused by End-of-life vehicles, Toyota launched the Toyota Global 100 Dismantlers* Project, to establish social systems for End-of-life vehicle proper treatment.
In order to realize an ideal resource-recycling based society, it is necessary to grasp the risks of resource depletion and the possibility of creating business opportunities, and initiatives are needed in four key areas: (1) use


Related SDGs
 
eco-friendly materials, (2) use auto parts longer, (3) develop recycling technologies, and (4) manufacture vehicles from End-of-life vehicles. Toyota aims to realize the ultimate recycling-based society, and promotes the Toyota Global Car-to-Car Recycle Project so that we can utilize resources from End-of-life vehicles for manufacturing new vehicles.
Through these initiatives, we will contribute to achieving SDG 9.1 (infrastructure development), 9.4 (sustainable industrial processes),
11.6 (reduction of environmental impact of cities), 12.2 (sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources), 12.4 (management of waste), and 12.5 (reduction of waste).
*	Dismantlers: Operates dismantling business for vehicles


 
bumpers replaced at dealers as a way to reduce the usage of petroleum-derived plastics. Some plastic parts collected from End-of-life vehicles are reused for energy as a heat source except using for used parts. Others are recycled into plastics for non- automobile use after going through a machine-automated sorting process.
Amid the growing need to further promote plastic recycling, we will encourage even greater utilization of recycled plastics and continue to study new technologies for collecting and recycling plastics from End-of-life vehicles to support sustainable economic growth globally.
  Environmental Data p. 100-I


Promote the Reuse of Rare Resources and Recycled Materials Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), and other electrified vehicles use significant amounts of rare resources compared to conventional gasoline vehicles. Some of these resources often carry risks such as resource depletion or uneven supply among regions. In order to promote the reuse of rare resources and recycled materials, we are collaborating with partner companies to establish a framework for collecting and recycling HEV batteries and automobile motor parts, along with cemented carbide tools used in production. HEV batteries, for example, contain rare metals such as nickel and cobalt. Since launching the first-generation Prius in 1997, we have built our own recovery network to collect End-of-life HEV batteries for recycling and reuse. As of March 2019, we collected a cumulative total of 132,000 End-of-life HEV batteries.

Toyota began recycling automobile motor magnets in 2012. As of March 2019, we collected a cumulative 41 tons of magnets, recycling rare earth.
For cemented carbide tools, we launched a system to extract and recycle tungsten* in 2010. As of March 2019, we recycled a cumulative total of approximately 196 tons of cemented carbide tools. The use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) is expected to increase in the future to support the design of light-weight vehicles.
Development of technologies for material recycling of CFRP is ongoing. As electrified vehicles become increasingly widespread, the amounts of End-of-life parts, such as batteries and motors that contain rare resources, are expected to increase.
We will continue material recycling activities.
* Tungsten: Japan imports all of its demand for tungsten, which is used in the cutting edges of 80 percent of cemented carbide tools
 
TMT, a Thailand-based affiliate, is implementing a variety of initiatives to achieve the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050.
In November 2018, TMT opened Toyota Ayutthaya Green Town, an embodiment of the six challenges of the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, at Ayutthaya, a famous World Heritage site.
At the facility, visitors can use Ha:mo, ultra-compact BEVs, which are also available for tourism use at Ayutthaya. The vehicles are largely powered with carbon-free renewable electricity generated from solar panels installed on the roof of the parking facility. To store charging electricity, a battery station that reuses End-of-life batteries from HEVs is also installed, enabling excess power to be effectively utilized.
In response to the increased use of electrified vehicles, in May 2019
 
TMT began production of onboard batteries at its Gateway Plant in Chachoengsao Province and establishing a 3R (Rebuild, Reuse, Recycle) scheme for End-of-life batteries.
TMT is creating a resource recycling scheme whereby the modules that can be reused will be employed in stationary battery stations to store power in plants and homes, while modules that cannot be reused will be sent to a newly established recycling plant for use as materials in new batteries and stainless steel.
This is the first such 3R measure for HEV batteries outside of Japan. It will contribute to reducing waste and the development of a recycling-based economy in Thailand and is expected to promote the effective use of renewable energy.

Achieve Industry-leading Levels in Easy-to-dismantle Design for Effective Resource Recycling

 
To promote material recycling of End-of-life vehicles, Toyota directly visits dismantling companies in Japan and overseas to investigate actual conditions and gain insight into the development of vehicle structure that makes it easy to dismantle and separate parts. We have actively adopted these designs for new models since 2003 with the launch of the Raum passenger car.
The new Century, Corolla Sport, Crown, and Lexus ES and UX launched in FY2019 adopt the TNGA1, a new concept for car manufacturing. These vehicles continue to incorporate easy-to-dismantle designs to
 
ensure safe and speedy dismantling operations.
In other areas where we adopt new structures, parts, and other technologies, we will continue to ensure easy-to-dismantle designs in order to maintain and enhance the capability to dismantle vehicles.

Contribute Worldwide Through Appropriate End-of-life Vehicle Treatment and Recycling Technology Developed in Japan
When End-of-life vehicles are not properly disposed or dismantled, this may not only affect regional environments, but also cause risks to the health and safety of local residents. To prevent these problems, we promote the Toyota Global 100 Dismantlers Project. Through this project, we aim to establish social systems for properly treating of
End-of-life vehicles without imposing regional environmental impact. By using our long-established technologies and know-how, we contribute to the establishment of social systems for appropriate End-of-life vehicle treatment. In FY2019, in addition to surveys
conducted in the Asia region, we started surveys on End-of-life vehicle treatment in the Africa region. On the other hand, in developed countries, we prepared a video manual on large battery removal for PHEVs and began preparing a video manual on hydrogen gas removal for FCEVs, which is expected to occur in the future.
We will continuously research the flow of End-of-life vehicles, setting treatment levels according to the conditions of national and regional infrastructures and work to establish model facilities in cooperation with local affiliates.
Through the Toyota Global 100 Dismantlers Project, we will strive to establish recycling-based societies that enable efficient resource recycling with proper treatment of waste oil, fluids, and CFC/HFC gas at model facilities and take measures such as calling on national governments to ensure that such measures take root as social systems.
 

Prepare Video Manual on Battery Removal for PHEV

As PHEVs and FCEVs become more common, proper removal of batteries and hydrogen tanks and release of hydrogen gas will become issues that need to be addressed. Since batteries are high-voltage and hydrogen tanks are under high pressure, it is important to ensure safety during the dismantling process.
To respond to these issues, we prepared a video manual on how to remove large-sized batteries as reference material for proper battery removal not only in Japan, but in each country and region. The videos cover six topics: (1) How to identify between PHEV, BEV, and HEV; (2) Precautions for removing; (3) Procedures for removing and storage ; (4) Check for any abnormality in damaged batteries; (5) Storage of vehicles submerged or damaged by accidents; and (6) Inspection and preparation prior to transportation. Detailed explanations are also provided on the tools to be used and methods of ensuring safety during removal of heavy, high-voltage batteries. There is no narration in this prepared video, but English subtitles are inserted.
This video will be used as master for localization of narration and subtitles for each country and region to support battery removal.
 

 

Model Vehicle Dismantling Facility Established (Vietnam)

In April 2019, TMV, a Vietnam-based affiliate, set up a model End-of- life vehicle dismantling facility* in Phuc Yen City, Vinh Phuc Province. Under the support of TDEM, the Asian regional headquarters in Thailand, this facility was set up by referring to the preceding model in Thailand and as the second model facility in Southeast Asia supporting the Toyota Global 100 Dismantlers Project.
Infrastructure for the proper treatment of End-of-life vehicles has not been established in Vietnam, and operations that have negative impacts on the environment such as dumping waste oil and fluids and releasing CFC/ HFC gas into the atmosphere are conducted. This model facility finally reached establishment, by securing proper treatment of End-of-life vehicles through the guidance of dismantling methods to the existing recycling company by TMV environmental team. Setting up such a model facility is expected to prevent water and soil contamination through the proper treatment of waste oil and fluids and prevent global warming through collection and thermal treatment of CFC/HFC gas.
We plan to make further efforts to incorporate proper treatment of End-of-life vehicles into the social system in Vietnam in collaboration with the government and other involved parties.
In Vietnam, a regulation on establishment of collection sites for End-of-life vehicles and motorcycles took effect in January 2018, and it is expected to further accelerate the proper treatment of End-of-life vehicles.

Expand Original Recycling Systems for End-of-life Vehicles Worldwide
 
Reduce Waste and Use Resources Efficiently in Production Activities
 


In order to realize an ultimate recycling-based society, we promote the Toyota Car-to-Car Recycle Project that is based on the concepts of reduce, reuse, and recycle, aiming specifically at elimination of resource-related risks and global warming.
In FY2019, we revalidated systems for the collection and proper treatment of HEV batteries globally. We also reinforced information sharing with a focus on the main regions where electrified vehicles have already been introduced and identified issues in each region. The ultimate goal of this project is closed-loop recycling, the concept that the vehicles parts and materials are recycled into identical parts. We will continue promoting “Car-to-Car Recycling” through gradual
 
Toyota strives to reduce the waste volume from production activities by developing and deploying new production technologies while taking continual daily measures in terms of the sources of waste (design and production method innovations), resource recycling, resulting cost reductions, and so forth.
In FY2019, Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) shifted from paying for recycling to selling recycling materials as valuable goods and so on, by reducing the water content of grinding dust. The total waste volume, as a result, was 32.2 thousand tons (down 1.5 percent year on year), and the waste volume per unit produced was 11.2 kg
 
(down 0.4 percent year on year).
Globally, the waste volume increased in some areas due to increases in production in conjunction with the establishment of new lines. On the other hand, by reducing the amount of water in paint sludge and by the changes in recycling markets, corrugated boards and scrap woods were converted into valuable materials and the waste volume was reduced in some areas. The total waste volume, as a result, was 496 thousand tons (down 0.6 percent year on year), and the waste volume per unit produced was 46.2 kg (down 2.7 percent year on year).

Reduce Packaging and Wrapping Materials and Use Resources Efficiently in Logistics Activities

 
Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) is taking a broad range of initiatives to reduce the amount of packaging and wrapping materials used in logistics. These include increasing packaging efficiency in shipping containers, using returnable containers* to reduce the amount of unrecyclable materials used, and making packaging and wrapping materials simplified and lighter.
In FY2019, TMC succeeded in reducing the usage of packaging and wrapping material per shipment unit to 6.21 kg/m3 (same as the previous year) by making packaging and wrapping materials smaller
 
and adopting returnable shipping containers. The total usage of packaging and wrapping materials amounted to 46.4 thousand tons (up 1.3 percent year on year).
On a global basis, Toyota continued efforts to gather and share information on best practices at each affiliate.
Moving forward, we will promote the efficient use of resources when shipping goods, while striving to reduce the usage of packaging and wrapping materials.

It is critical for humans to conserve forests and other natural environments in all regions for coexistence in harmony with nature. However, deforestation is progressing across the world, resulting in the fragmentation of diverse living creature habitats, as well as the continuing loss of biodiversity. This entails a number of issues including the loss of biological resources that are essential for society, causing natural disasters, and spurring global warming, and we believe that it poses a risk to the potential for the sustainability of the entire society.
In light of this risk, Toyota launched Harmony with Nature projects and is taking action to expand “Connecting Communities” activities
 
in various regions of Japan and overseas in order to “enrich the lives of communities” in each region.
Toyota is also developing “Connecting with the World” environmental activities in collaboration with NGOs in Japan and overseas, as well as “Connecting to the Future” environmental education activities targeting Toyota employees and the next generation. We aim for a future where people and nature live in harmony by these three “connecting” activities.
Through these initiatives, we will contribute to achieving SDG 12.8 (sustainable lifestyle), 15.1 (conservation of terrestrial ecosystem), and 15.a (secure financial resources).

Community-based Plant in Harmony with Nature Afforestation activities have been conducted since 2007 with the theme of creation of forests at plant sites. The Tsutsumi Plant, where the Prius is produced, serves as a model plant for this project.
Having developed our activities as a “Plant in Harmony with Nature” since FY2018, we have expanded on our work to include the management of various living creature habitats.
In October 2018, as part of this initiative, we opened Biotope Tsutsumi, in order to help conserve the original local ecosystem. Based on the concept of a traditional Japanese broad-leaved satoyama forest consisting primarily of the konara oak, the Biotope Tsutsumi environment integrates waterside, grassland, forest, and other natural areas. Representative animal and plant species have been selected as indicator species to provide quantitative measurements that will allow objective evaluations and a regular cycle of reviews of the project details. Furthermore, the project is also introducing fish species compatible with the local ecosystem (ginbuna) and conserving rare fish species (minami medaka and ushimotsugo).
These activities are being pursued as a collaborative and unified effort with local residents, under the guidance of the city of Toyota and various experts. Recognized for these activities, the project won the Biotope Grand Prize at the 11th Biotope Recognition Event (FY2019).
We will use the Tsutsumi Plant as a model project, to actively promote environmental conservation activities rooted in the local ecosystem, by assessing suitable initiatives at Toyota’s other production plants worldwide.

Boost Grant for Environmental Activities Connecting with the World—Toyota Today for Tomorrow Project

We have established the Toyota Today for Tomorrow Project to bolster our long-standing Toyota Environmental Activities Grant Program and afforestation projects in China and the Philippines on a global basis. With the aim of contributing to society, we will work together with organizations engaged in nature conservation around the world by establishing projects to solve issues in the areas of living in harmony with nature and biodiversity.

Toyota Collaborates with IUCN to Enhance Species Conservation Data
Toyota began a five-year partnership with IUCN1 in May 2016 to promote scientific understanding of the biodiversity crisis.
Under the partnership, we provide annual grants of approximately
1.2	million U.S. dollars, supporting the IUCN to enhance the IUCN Red List2.
With this support, the IUCN will conduct assessments of extinction risk for more than 28,000 species, accounting for 35 percent of species requiring assessment. This represents a major step forward in the IUCN’s goal of gaining more comprehensive view of the conservation status of biodiversity on the Earth.
The support also enabled the IUCN to enhance its Red List website, which can now immediately display photo, habitat, and other information on the species when its name is entered, improving the website’s ease of viewing and usability.

Toyota Environmental Activities Grant Program
In 1999, Toyota was honored with the Global 500 Award from the United Nations Environment Programme. To commemorate receipt of this award, in FY2001, we launched the Toyota Environmental Activities Grant Program to support the environmental activities of NPOs and other groups. The main themes of the grant program are biodiversity and climate change. Grants are offered to support projects overseas (up to seven million yen per project) and projects in Japan (up to three million yen or one million yen per project). Over the 19 years since the program was established, we have supported 387 projects in 54 countries and regions worldwide.

Toyota has made annual one million U.S. dollar grants to WWF since 2016 to support the Living Asian Forest Project. The Living Asian Forest Project aims to strengthen existing WWF activities to conserve tropical forests and wildlife in Southeast Asia and launch new conservation activities.

FY2019 Activities:
Protected Sumatran Rhinoceros, a Designated Endangered Species The population of the Sumatran rhinoceros has declined to the point where continued breeding in the wild might be difficult, leading to concern about their extinction. Therefore, urgent conservation actions were required.
Beginning in 2013, WWF Japan and WWF Indonesia have been carrying out conservation activities in forests inhabited by Sumatran rhinoceroses. And, in November 2018, these organizations successfully rescued a Sumatran rhinoceros on the island of Borneo and immediately transferred it to a safe protective facility.
Safely capturing an animal living in a high-risk area was hailed as a very positive event by interested parties. Additionally, continued patrol of the Tesso Nilo National Park has significantly reduced illegal logging of the forest.
 
Nature-based Solutions by Urban Green Infrastructure
The Toshima Green Infrastructure Network (TGIN), based in Toyoshima Ward, is seeking ideal forms of urban green infrastructures* that address issues presented in local communities, and then promotes and implements such infrastructures. Green infrastructures are being implemented in collaboration with local store associations, local residents, local governments, NPOs, and Taisho University students.
For example, TGIN has created a rooftop farm and a rain garden at the Taisho University Nishisugamo campus, where TGIN is based, and is searching for ways to use green infrastructures to solve various societal challenges, such as the heat and heavy rain caused by climate change, earthquakes that directly hit the capital, and biodiversity loss.
Additionally, TGIN is communicating ideal forms of urban green infrastructures to society at large. It is trying to increase the scale of its activities through collaboration with initiatives in other regions inside and outside Japan, as well as mutual learning.
* Urban green infrastructure is an initiative that promotes wise utilization of nature’s functions within urban areas in order to promote sustainable communities, such as growing a variety of crops in rooftop farms at Taisho University (The Gamall Farm) and having children in the neighboring communities come on a tour or experience harvesting
 
Future Creation Project Through Local Knowledge and Traditional Knowledge of the Karen Tribe
Conference of Earth Environment from Akita is working on conserving the ecosystem services in the very biologically diverse Kaeng Krachan Forest Complex (KKFC) in Thailand, as well as on building an effective and balanced resource management system.
The goal of this project is to create villages in which people’s livelihood and nature conservation can coexist by utilizing the inherited local knowledge and traditions of the Karen tribe living in KKFC that contribute to sustainable utilization of natural and cultural resources. Specific initiatives included supporting introduction of sustainable organic farming, and developing teaching materials for building a sustainable community, targeted at elementary and junior high school students. Furthermore, since many similar issues are found throughout Asia, the project is also taking actions to spread the initiative to other regions, for example, holding workshops that cover a wide area in order to develop the human resources necessary for continuing activities and build consensus.
The project has helped people deepen their understanding about the value of natural resources and continue to autonomously manage the systems that have been built.

Boost Contributions to Environmental Education Connecting to the Future
—Toyota ESD Project
Human resources development is crucial for expanding environmental conservation activities to the future. Consequently, the Toyota Education for Sustainable Development Project promotes sustainable human resource development suited to local communities. Our corporate training approach is to nurture environmentally conscious employees and leverage their awareness to make it better for business. Additionally, we are connecting our training activities to the future by making the best use of the features of business sites and company-owned fields to provide environmental education for children, who will be responsible for sustainable societies in the future.

Toyota Shirakawa-Go Eco-Institute
In 2015, to commemorate the institute’s 10th anniversary, we enhanced the hands-on nature programs. The institute emphasis on a “children’s camp” that nurtures children’s environmental awareness, self-reliance, and ability to take action, through shared education as a new theme, that enhances growing and learning together toward living in harmony with nature.
The total number of people staying overnight at Shirakawa-Go in FY2019 was 15,480, and 10,113 people participated in institute programs during the year. Toyota Shirakawa-Go Eco-Institute will continue to develop new hands-on nature programs to nurture an awareness of living in harmony with nature among a growing number
 

governments, and NPOs.
Three lecturers conducted lectures and discussions entitled “Biodiversity from the SDGs perspective,” “Education at Toyota Shirakawa-Go Eco-Institute for nurturing people who bear the future,” and “Methodology for communicating SDGs.” The participants also experienced the programs being implemented at the institute.
Some of the participants commented, “Now I understand the global flow surrounding SDGs,” “The forum helped me realize what I need to do to switch to thinking that these problems are mine, not someone else’s,” and “I learned the joy of observing nature.”
The Forum’s results are posted on the institute’s website.
With the goal of helping enhance the value of hands-on nature education in Japan, SDGs Education Forum will continue planning a variety of initiatives.

FY2019 Activities: Planned and Implemented Dragonfly Observation Tour
In 2017, we hosted the “Future of Harmony between People and Nature as Learned from Dragonflies,” held in the Forest of Toyota featuring the living creatures of satoyama. As a follow-on activity, in July 2018, we held an event in which participants themselves planned and implemented a dragonfly-based environmental education program.
Dragonflies are familiar creatures that make use of the waterside environments that people create in their lives. They can be easily adopted as an environmental education theme because their egg- laying and hatching behaviors can be observed.
An expert provided basic knowledge about dragonflies, including the roles they play in the ecosystem and the current status of marshes they inhabit, and the forest interpreter explained the detailed ecology and key points in planning an observation tour. The participants considered the impact people have on nature and the need for living in harmony with nature. After planning an observation tour designed to convey these types of information, they utilized handmade goods modeled after dragonflies to convey the importance of natural environment conservation to parent-child members collected by Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA) Aichi Toyota.
Comments were received such as, “I learned that it is necessary to protect the natural environment in order to also protect dragonflies” (from one parent-child pair) and “I learned the secrets for planning observation tours, which will be very useful in my future activities” (from a planning participant).

Promoting Environmental Contributions Through Biotechnology and Afforestation Business, Automotive Peripheral Technologies, and Forest Conservation Activities

 
Toyota Mie Miyagawa Mountain Forest
Planted Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress trees account for approximately 80 percent of the 1,702 ha of forest Toyota has owned in Odai Town, Taki District of Mie Prefecture since 2007. Although this region has the history of timber industry, a decline in domestic forestry had left much of the forest unmaintained. Over the last 10 years, we have been thinning the forest, and as well as providing other functions which benefit the public, such as soil and water conservation, we have also been extracting and utilizing logs that can be used as lumber. Furthermore, by introducing automobile manufacturing expertise to forest management, we are achieving efficient management.

FY2019 Activities:
Forest Challenge and Development Project
In FY2018, we started a new project, the Forest Challenge and Development, aiming for new utilization of trees and spaces. Business plans were widely collected from the public, and participants selected through screening started their projects in April 2018.
One of the participants, a woodworking artist, is collaborating with a local, nationally renowned frame maker to develop carefully designed wooden products for daily life. He is also promoting a project that connects items produced from forests with consumers who use those items, while deepening his connection with the local community, for example, by holding a woodworking workshop at local Subaru Gakuen High School, Mie Prefecture.

   
Woodworking workshop	Hand-carved butter knives
 
As one of the new projects, an event to walk with your dog in the forest called “Doggies Playing in the Forest” was held. Based on a desire to help city dwellers become more interested in forests, the event was designed to increase people’s awareness about forests and forestry while enjoying a walk in the forest with dogs rather than just simply strolling in the forest. We are aiming to build a framework that can return the profits from the events to the forests.
Through these initiatives, we are hoping to increase the number of people who are involved with forests and trees, and promote new future projects so that our program can become a model for revitalizing local communities and forests.

Initiatives at the New Toyota R&D Center Promoting Harmony with Nature and Local Communities
Toyota is constructing a new R&D Center in the overlapping area of
Toyota City and Okazaki City. This new facility will be a hub for development of sustainable next-generation mobility.
The main design concept is a technical center in harmony with nature and local communities. About 60 percent of the total project site will be conserved as areas for the regeneration of forests and management of valley bottom rice fields in collaboration with the local community.
In April 2019, work was completed on the central section of the new R&D Center which takes a county road as its primarily feature. Partial operation of the site as “Toyota Technical Center Shimoyama” is now underway.
 
Toyota intends to continue cooperating with experts, local governments, and local residents to conduct environmental conservation activities in the forest and valley bottom rice fields of this valuable satoyama ecosystem. We also plan to actively share information including the status of these activities and findings gained from them.

 

FY2019 Activities:
Confirmed Nesting of Japanese Night Heron at Business Site Since the start of site preparation in 2012, nesting by Japanese night heron was confirmed at business site for the first time.
After nesting was confirmed, several protective steps were implemented under the guidance of experts. For example, slope- planting work and blasting near the nesting site were temporarily halted, and entry by weed-cutting workers was restricted. We plan to continue creating habitats friendly to a variety of living organisms.

At Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC), Operating Officers entrusted by the Board of Directors make timely decisions and carry out environmental initiatives. The Sustainability Meeting, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), deliberates on key issues such as
 
Toyota formulated the Toyota Earth Charter (established in 1992 and revised in 2000) as a policy for environmental initiatives based on the Guiding Principles at Toyota (established in 1992 and revised in 1997) to contribute to the sustainable development of society and the earth through its corporate activities.
In addition, the Toyota Global Vision announced in 2011 emphasizes the importance of “Respect for the Planet” and positions the environment as one of three values* that Toyota provides to society. Based on this approach, Toyota formulated the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 in 2015 as its long-term vision for environmental initiatives, and in FY2017 launched the Sixth Toyota Environmental Action Plan (FY2017–2021). Toyota is identifying

environmental risks and opportunities that can affect business operations and incorporating them into management plans to work for sustainable development in harmony with society. Under this structure, Toyota is promoting steadily, the environmental management activities globally, including legal compliance activities, collaboration with business partners, and employee education.
Through these activities, we will contribute to achieving SDG 3.9 (reduction of environmental pollution), 6.3 (improvement of water quality), 11.6 (reduction of environmental impact of cities), 12.4 (management of waste), 12.6 (adopt sustainable practices and integrate sustainability information), and 12.8 (sustainable lifestyle).
* Three values: Safety, environment, and waku-doki (excitement and exhilaration that wows you)
 
corporate governance and risk management, as well as environmental risks, opportunities, and actions to be taken in response.
TMC also set “environment KPIs (CO2),” as indicators of the progress of measures to reduce CO2 in products and production, and reports on them as key management information twice annually at meetings attended by all Executives and those above Field General Manager.
In addition, TMC has three core Environmental Committees: the Environmental Product Design Assessment Committee, the Production Environment Committee, and the Resource Recycling Committee. These committees consider issues and responses, and all relevant divisions work together to carry out company-wide initiatives.

Legal Compliance Activities
Toyota aims to ensure that its production activities pose zero environmental risk to local communities. The foundation of our efforts is preventive measures to avoid non-compliance issues and complaints.
Neglecting preventive measures can lead to situations where non-compliance may occur. We consider these situations to be non-compliance near-misses, and we take stringent measures to root out the causes of these near-misses and prevent reoccurrence. For incidents posing significant risk, we share information on reoccurrence prevention measures through environmental affairs meetings at all Group companies. Additionally, we are taking measures to completely eliminate the use of ozone-depleting substances, and no significant releases have been found.
In FY2019, Toyota was not involved in any major environmental incidents causing air or water pollution, nor was the Group subject to fines or penalties. However, there were six minor non-compliance issues among the environmental management companies (five in Japan and one overseas).
We continued to outsource proper treatment of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB). Also, due to amendment of the Act on Special Measures concerning Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Wastes, we are conducting
 

Reduce VOC Emissions in Production Activities

VOCs* are one of the causes of photochemical oxidation, the cause of photochemical smog. Toyota has been striving to reduce VOCs emitted in vehicle painting processes. Specifically, we have reduced the use of paints and thinners, continuously promoting initiatives linked to painting facility refurbishment plans and day-to-day activities to reduce VOC emissions.
In FY2019, as a result of a higher production rate of models with high design levels and quality requirements, usage of paint materials increased and the volume of VOC emissions per area painted in TMC body painting processes (average for all lines) was 15.0 g/m2 (up 4.2 percent year on year). For TMC and its consolidated subsidiaries in Japan, VOC emissions volume was 21.5 g/m2 (same as the previous year).
Also, the volume of VOC emissions per area painted in TMC bumper painting processes (average for all lines) was 176 g/m2 (down 0.4 percent year on year).

Promote Environmental Activities in Cooperation with Business Partners (Suppliers)

 
Initiatives in Accordance with the Green Purchasing Guidelines
Toyota purchases a wide range of materials, parts, and equipment from many different suppliers. We have collaborated with suppliers on implementing environmental initiatives through TOYOTA Green Purchasing Guidelines1, seminars, and other means.
After announcing the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, we revised guidelines in January 2016, working with suppliers to maintain existing measures including compliance with the laws and regulations of each country and managing substances of concern and undertake an even broader range of environmental initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases, assess water risks and reduce impact on water environments from those risks, encourage resource recycling, and protect ecosystems in support of the Challenge.
We request that our tier 1 suppliers to roll out environmental initiatives to their suppliers, and we seek to realize the entire supply chain2 management in the pursuit of a sustainable society.
Toyota released the Green Purchasing Guidelines published not only in Japan, but also at overseas purchasing sites. We will continue to request suppliers to promote initiatives in accordance with the guideline.
1	Green Purchasing Guidelines: Prioritizing the purchase of parts, materials, equipment, and services with a low environmental footprint when manufacturing products
2	Supply chain: The entire flow of business activities related to a product, from procurement of materials for manufacturing, to production control, logistics, and sales


Mutual Study About the Environment
We study environmental issues with suppliers through a variety of opportunities.
CSR Seminars are held each year, and at the FY2019 session, environmental initiatives were explained with a focus on the 2030 Milestone announced in September 2018, and once again requested the cooperation and collaboration of suppliers.
In January 2019, theme-specific research groups of the Kyohokai, which is consisted of more than 200 parts suppliers, commenced activities on environmental topics. The aim is to enhance environmental management of each company by exchanging information among companies and conducting lectures by experts.

Recognition of Suppliers’ Environmental Initiatives Started
Toyota established the Environmental Activity Awards in FY2018 to commend suppliers who make company-wide efforts with major contributions to conduct environmental initiatives throughout the vehicle lifecycle and entire supply chain.
 
Assessing Risks and Opportunities Related to Climate Change and the Water Environment in Supply Chains
We introduced the CDP Supply Chain Program in FY2016 to support continuous environmental initiatives
conducted with suppliers. The program enables us to assess environmental risks and opportunities across the supply chain.
We have been enhancing the quality of the program’s activities through communication with suppliers.

Ensuring Compliance with REACH and Other Global Regulations on Chemical Substances
In order to minimize severe negative impacts on human health and the environment due to the production and use of chemical substances, nations are strengthening laws related to chemical substances, which include the Chemical Substances Control Law in Japan, and the ELV Directive3 and REACH regulation4 in Europe. To properly respond to these regulations, Toyota has built and is operating chemical substance management frameworks in cooperation with its suppliers.
We continued these efforts in FY2019 and asked suppliers in Japan to conduct self-assessments of their operations. We also worked with suppliers to take further measures. We also shared these efforts to main overseas sites.

Promote Environmental Activities in Cooperation with Business Partners (Dealers and Distributors)

Toyota has strong bonds of trust with its dealers and distributors built on shared values for products and services, supporting a long history of collaborative initiatives in environmental activities. Given their direct contact with customers, dealers are a critical partner in carrying out environmental initiatives.
In Japan, Toyota works with the Toyota National Dealers’ Advisory Council to promote unified efforts among all dealers to implement voluntary activities based on the Toyota Dealer CSR Guidelines.
In overseas regions, we strongly promote environmental management through environmental activities led by regional headquarters and distributors along with continual DERAP5 implementation.

Raise Ratio of Dealers Achieving DERAP
Toyota continues to implement the Dealer Environmental Risk Audit Program (DERAP) to reduce environmental risks at overseas dealer service shops. This program is intended to conduct audits of five fundamental environmental items including the proper management of waste and treatment of water discharge.
In FY2019, a total of 99 distributors and 4,506 dealers from 96 countries worldwide participated in DERAP, an increase of 7 distributors and 210 dealers from FY2018. All 5 requirements were satisfied by 4,325 dealers, 96 percent of all participating dealers (up 1 percent year on year).
We will continue to support expansion of DERAP participation and support dealers and distributors such as by creating environmental guidelines for each overseas region based on global environmental guidelines and determining the status of operations.

Further Strengthen Global Employee Education and Awareness Activities

In accordance with the national policies of Japan, Toyota designated June as its “Toyota Environment Month” in 1973 and has been taking measures since then to raise employees’ awareness and actions for the environment. In 1991, we changed the name to “Toyota Global Environment Month,” and we are expanding activities globally.
We ensure that all global employees are aware of Toyota Global Environment Month by distributing the President’s message on the
 
Toyota Global Environment Month is considered to be one part of
these measures.
For each program, a cycle with three phases—know, learn, and act by taking voluntary action—are performed with regard to the environment, and options are available for each rank according to the level of employees’ awareness and environmental understanding.
In FY2019, we took measures to encourage better understanding of the content of the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 and generate action. To raise interest, throughout the year we devised innovations such as “information that can be touched” and “information that enters the eyes.”

Phase: Know
Following the measures taken in FY2018 including the use of digital signage installed in various locations throughout the company to disseminate environmental information and displaying educational screens when PCs are started, in FY2019, we undertook new measures that address the issue of water and wildlife conservation. During the Water Week Campaign in August, a special page was created on the intranet to inform employees about water issues and the importance of water resources. Educational stickers were also utilized within the company to convey the importance of water resources. In addition, to promote World Water Day (March 22), fun in-house events were conducted such as requesting employees to collect pictures related to water or something blue, wearing something blue and taking photos with Toyota’s environmental character. These innovative measures were taken to lower the hurdles to participation and educate participants on the importance of natural water.
 
The Toyota Saves the Wildlife Campaign was launched in September 2018 as a new internal appeal concerning the Toyota Today for Tomorrow Project, a part of Challenge 6. During the campaign, special pages were created on the intranet to present information on Toyota’s collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with which Toyota has established global partnerships, and goods with an original Toyota and WWF logo and other items were sold in the in-house shop. The “WITH STAMP” seals, which combine a family name with the image of an endangered animal, were extremely popular and approximately 700 seals were sold. A portion of the sales proceeds were allocated to WWF activities for protecting the natural environment.
Posters highlighting Toyota’s initiatives with the WWF and IUCN were prepared and distributed to divisions in January and February 2019, respectively. The posters were also displayed in key stations in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka in March, raising awareness and understanding.

Similar to the previous year, an Environmental Campaign of Creative Suggestion System was conducted as a main program of Toyota Global Environment Month, and a wide variety of environmental proposals were submitted, raising awareness.
In addition, measures were taken during the period from October to December, which includes Eco-Drive Month in November, to raise awareness and increase understanding among employees regarding eco-driving.
Continuing from the previous year, in FY2019 we sought to learn and gain understanding by distributing messages about eco-driving that draw attention through surprise.
Specifically, we created posters that create a lasting impression with messages that cite 10 key elements of eco-driving recommendations intertwined with athletes affiliated with Toyota.

New Employee Training Program Raises Sense of Ownership In FY2019, new employee training program was conducted for approximately 690 employees and included courses by the Environmental Affairs Division on the fundamentals of global environmental issues, Toyota’s
environmental initiatives, and environmental risks Toyota is facing. The training provides an opportunity for employees to consider and be aware of the environment as a personal issue after they are assigned and to acquire
 
the basis for putting that awareness into practice in their day-to-day activities.

Enhance Active Disclosure of Environmental Information and Communication

Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) strives to proactively disclose environmental information and enhance its communication through an annual Environmental Report, its website, and events.
In February 2019, our Environmental Report 2018 won the Grand Prize (Minister of the Environment Prize) in the Environmental Reporting Category at the 22nd Environmental Communication Awards sponsored by Ministry of the Environment of Japan and other organizations. The investigation of climate-related risks and opportunities based on the 2°C and beyond 2°C scenarios, the logic of the 2030 Milestone that was set toward the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, and other elements were highly evaluated.

On the corporate website, pages were reorganized according to ESG frameworks to convey information about Toyota’s initiatives in a more understandable manner. In conjunction with announcement of the 2030 Milestone, the environmental challenge page was updated to comprehensively explain current conditions and the status sought for 2030 and 2050.
Toyota produced three sequels of “econohito,” which is a web video content featuring employees who undertake environmental activities toward achieving the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050. The new contents covered Challenge 6. Social media was also utilized to disseminate environmental information.

We also produced and posted videos to raise interest in Toyota’s environmental initiatives among the general public and provided them to overseas affiliates. The video introducing the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 employs pop-style animation.
A video promoting Challenge 6: Toyota Today for Tomorrow Project introduced a new technique—popping the world’s largest scale bubble wrap art—to introduce Toyota’s environmental conservation activities undertaken with the IUCN.

At events, workshops and other programs are conducted to raise environmental awareness.
At the Water is Life 2018 (global high school students conference) held in July 2018, we conducted a workshop with Shibuya Kyoiku Gakuen Shibuya Junior and Senior High School and Shibuya Kyoiku Gakuen Makuhari Junior and Senior High School and implemented a hands-on, easily understood program with a focus on Toyota’s water-related initiatives.
We also had a booth at the Junior Eco-Club National Festival 2019 held in March 2019, where we used fill-in-the-blank quizzes and animated video to convey in a fun manner the key points of Toyota’s environmental initiatives.

Corporate Governance


   Fundamental Approach	

Toyota regards sustainable growth and the stable, long-term enhancement of corporate value as essential management priorities. Building positive relationships with all stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, business partners, local communities and employees, and consistently providing products that satisfy customers are key to addressing these priorities. To this end, Toyota constantly seeks to enhance corporate governance.
Moreover, Toyota complies with the general principles of the Corporate Governance Code. The specifics of these efforts are discussed in Sustainability Meetings and reported to the Board of Directors.

 


Business Execution and Supervision
With the aim of achieving the Toyota Global Vision, Toyota has been implementing ongoing revisions in its operational framework in order to quickly respond to the unprecedentedly rapid changes occurring in the external environment. Since 2011, to accelerate decision making and operational execution, Toyota has been undertaking a variety of reforms, including the introduction of the in-house company system.
In 2018, to accelerate management oversight that is fully coordinated with the workplace, Toyota moved up the timing for changing the executive lineup from April to January, revised the corporate strategy function, and restructured the Japan Sales Business Group based on regions rather than sales channels. These organizational changes were designed to transform the company structure into one that facilitates decision making close to customers and close to where the action takes place.
In 2019, to further advance its “acceleration of management” and the development of a diverse and talented workforce, we made executive and organizational changes as follows.
・Executives are composed of only senior managing officers and people of higher rank.
・A new classification called “senior professional/senior management” (kanbushoku in Japanese) was
created replacing the following titles or ranks: managing officers, executive general managers, (sub- executive managerial level) senior grade 1 and senior grade 2 managers, and grand masters.
From the perspective of appointing the right people to the right positions, senior professionals/senior management are positioned in a wide range of posts, from chief officer, deputy chief officer, field general manager, and plant general manager to group manager, regardless of age or length of employment, to deal with management issues as they arise and to strengthen their development as part of a diverse and
 


talented workforce through genchi genbutsu (on-site learning and problem-solving). Executives themselves go to where the action is taking place and, together with senior professionals/senior management and other members of the workplace, give form in the real world to their visions for a future society of mobility. In the Sustainability Meetings, in which Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members also participate, the execution of operation is supervised from a societal perspective toward sustainable growth of the company and the corporate governance structure is deliberated.
In addition, we deliberate on and monitor management and corporate activities based on views of various stakeholders through a wide variety of deliberating bodies, including the Labor-Management Council/Joint Labor-Management Round Table Conference.

Board of Directors and Related Structures
The structures related to the Board of Directors are based on comprehensive considerations with the aim of ensuring prompt, appropriate decision making and appointing the right person to the right position. We believe that it is crucial to appoint individuals who comprehend and are capable of putting into practice its core concepts of making ever-better cars and genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience). Moreover, these individuals must be able to contribute to decision making aimed at sustainable growth into the future. Toyota’s Executive Appointment Meeting, of which the majority are Outside Directors, discusses recommendations with the Board of Directors regarding such appointments.
In order to ensure that outside perspectives are adequately reflected in management decision making, there are three Outside Directors, all of whom are registered as independent officers with the relevant financial instrument exchanges.
When selecting Outside Directors who will serve as independent officers, we consider the requirements set forth in the Companies Act and independence standards established by the relevant financial instrument exchanges. Our Outside Directors draw on their broad experience and insight, including their respective fields of expertise, to inform decision making from a perspective independent of management structure.

Audit & Supervisory Board
Toyota has adopted an Audit & Supervisory Board system. Six Audit & Supervisory Board Members (including three Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members) play a key role in Toyota’s corporate governance by undertaking audits in line with the audit policies and plans.
In appointing Audit & Supervisory Board Members, Toyota believes it is necessary to elect individuals who have broad experience and insight in their respective fields of expertise and can advise management from a fair and neutral perspective, as well as audit the execution of business. Toyota’s Executive Appointment Meeting, more than half of whose members are Outside Directors, discusses recommendations with the Audit & Supervisory Board regarding such appointments.
Three individuals, all of whom are registered as independent officers with the relevant financial instrument exchanges, have been appointed as Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members. When appointing Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, Toyota considers the requirements set forth in the Companies Act as well as the independence standards established by the relevant financial instrument exchanges.

Executive Compensation
The amount of executive compensation, how its calculation method is determined, and the calculation method are described below.

[Decision Policy and Decision Process]
The director compensation system is designed based on the following ideas.
•	The system should encourage Members of the Board of Directors to work to improve the medium- to long-term corporate value of Toyota
•	The system should maintain compensation levels that will allow Toyota to secure and retain talented personnel
•	The system should motivate Members of the Board of Directors to promote management from the same viewpoint as our shareholders with a stronger sense of responsibility as corporate managers
Remuneration for Members of the Board of Directors is effectively linked to corporate performance while reflecting individual job responsibilities and performance. Remuneration standards in each member’s home country are also taken into account when determining remuneration amounts and methods. Remuneration for Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members consists only of fixed payments. As a result, this remuneration is not readily impacted by business performance, helping to ensure independence from management.
The amounts of remuneration for Members of the Board of Directors and the remuneration system are decided by the Board of Directors and by the members of the Executive Compensation Meeting, a majority of whom are Outside Directors. The Board of Directors resolves the total amount of remuneration for a given fiscal year and delegates the determination of the amount of remuneration for each Member of the Board of Directors to the Executive Compensation Meeting. The Executive Compensation Meeting reviews
 
the remuneration system for Members of the Board of Directors and senior management, and determines the amount of remuneration for each Member of the Board of Directors, taking into account factors such as corporate performance, as well as individual job responsibilities and performance.
Remuneration for Audit & Supervisory Board Members is determined by the Audit & Supervisory Board within the scope determined by resolution of the Shareholders’ Meeting.
Additionally, we check the appropriateness of our executive compensation by referencing benchmarking results created by outside compensation consultants.

Overview of the Executive Compensation Meeting

Purpose and authority	Evaluation of the executive compensation system, and decision on individual remuneration amount is based on factors such as corporate performance, as well as individual job responsibilities and performance. (The Board of Directors resolves the total amount of remuneration for the current fiscal year and delegates the determination of individual remuneration amount to the Executive Compensation Meeting.)

[Method of Determining Performance-based Remuneration]
Remuneration for Members of the Board of Directors is effectively linked to corporate performance while reflecting individual job responsibilities and performance. Remuneration standards in each member’s home country are also taken into account when determining remuneration amounts and methods.

1)	Directors with Japanese citizenship (excluding Outside Directors)
Toyota sets the total amount of remuneration (Annual Total Remuneration) received by each Member of the Board of Directors in a year based on consolidated operating income, the volatility of the share price of Toyota and individual performance evaluation. The balance after deducting fixed remuneration from Annual Total Remuneration constitutes performance-based remuneration.
Explanation of Indicators

Consolidated operating income	Indicator for evaluating Toyota’s efforts based on business performance
Volatility of Toyota’s share price	Corporate value indicator for shareholders and investors to evaluate Toyota’s efforts
Individual performance evaluation	Qualitative evaluation of each director’s performance

Evaluation Method and Reference Value for Indicators, and Evaluation Result for the Current Fiscal Year
















Method of Setting the Annual Total Remuneration
Annual Total Remuneration is set for each Member of the Board of Directors based on consolidated operating income and the volatility of the share price of TMC, and then adjusted based on individual performance evaluation. Individual performance-based remuneration is set within the range of 10% above or below Annual Total Remuneration for each position.
 
Analysis and Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
After the Secretariat of the Board of Directors conducts a quantitative analysis of the state of the Board’s performance pursuant to an instruction of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, a survey is conducted of Members of the Board of Directors (Members of the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members) regarding the state of execution of operations and of the supervision of such execution.
Furthermore, interviews are held individually with Members of the Board of Directors, including the Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, based on results of the survey. The Secretariat of the Board of Directors’ Meeting combines and explains the findings to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and reports and discusses the findings at the Board of Directors’ Meeting.
For FY2019, it was confirmed, as a result of the evaluation, that effectiveness was secured.
However, since meaningful comments were provided during the process of the evaluation regarding “acceleration of decision making,” “management oversight of operations” and other matters, Toyota will make suggested improvements during FY2020 to further enhance effectiveness.
Corporate Governance Organizational Diagram (Emphasizing Frontline Operations + Multidirectional Monitoring)
 

2)	Directors with foreign citizenship (excluding Outside Directors)
Fixed remuneration and performance-based remuneration are set based on the remuneration levels and structures that allow TMC to secure and retain talented personnel. Fixed remuneration is set, taking into account each member’s job responsibilities and the remuneration standards of such members’ home countries. Performance-based remuneration is set based on consolidated operating income, the volatility of the share price of Toyota and individual performance, taking into account each member’s job responsibilities and the remuneration standards of such members’ home countries. The concept of each item is the same as for directors with Japanese citizenship (excluding Outside Directors).

[Share Compensation System]
The Board of Directors of TMC decides the share compensation, using the maximum share compensation (4.0 billion yen per year) set in the 115th Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting held on June 13, 2019.

Fundamental Approach and Maintenance of Internal Control Systems

Basic Stance on System for Ensuring Appropriate Business Operations
Toyota and its subsidiaries work to foster a sound corporate culture based on the Guiding Principles at Toyota and the Toyota Code of Conduct. Toyota integrates the principles of problem identification and kaizen (continuous improvement) into its operational processes and makes continuous efforts to train employees who will put these principles into practice.

System to Ensure Appropriate Operations
Toyota endeavors to maintain and properly operate a system for ensuring the appropriateness of business operations as a corporate group in accordance with its Basic Policies on Establishing Internal Controls.
Each fiscal year, Toyota inspects the establishment and implementation of internal controls to confirm that the organizational units responsible for implementing internal controls are functioning autonomously and enhancing internal controls as necessary. The findings of these inspections are reviewed in the Sustainability Meetings and the Board of Directors Meetings.

For details on Fundamental Approach and Maintenance of Internal Control Systems, please see “IV. Basic Approach to Internal Control System and its Development” in the Corporate Governance Report.

Risk Management


 
   Fundamental Approach	
 
Initiatives for Information Security
 

 
Toyota has been working to reinforce its risk management structure since the series of recall issues that occurred in 2010. In June 2010, Toyota established the Risk Management Committee (now Sustainability Meeting) and appointed risk managers globally and at each region and section to comprehensively prevent and mitigate the impact of risks that could arise in business activities.


Organization and Structure
 
With cyber attacks becoming more sophisticated and complicated, the targets of cyber attack are no longer limited to confidential information and information systems, but also include the networks of systems that control plant facilities and vehicles (such as on-board device systems). The importance of information security is increasing for Toyota.
 
To head global risk management, Toyota has appointed a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) who oversees significant risks and takes leadership to respond to significant global emergencies. Beneath the CRO are Regional CROs appointed to manage their own risk management structures.
Within head office departments (such as Accounting and Purchasing), risk management by function is assigned to chief officers and risk managers of individual divisions, while in individual
in-house companies, risk management by product is assigned to the company presidents and risk managers of individual divisions. This


Organization
 
makes it possible for them to coordinate and cooperate with the regional head offices and sections.
To oversee and mitigate global risks, we are enhancing our global risk management capability based on the Toyota Global Risk Management Standard (TGRS), which spells out Toyota’s globally common risk management policy, structure, and operating procedures. Additionally, to identify and implement the necessary risk-prevention actions, significant emerging risks are reported and reviewed in the Sustainability Meetings. To respond to emerging risks in recent years, Toyota advances measures related to information security and business continuity management (BCM). Risks related to Toyota’s businesses that could significantly impact the decisions of investors are listed in Form 20-F: Industry and Business Risks; Financial Market and Economic Risks; Regulatory, Legal, Political and Other Risks.
 
Toyota is committed to ensuring the safety and security of our customers from cyber attack threats and we consider it our social responsibility to protect our customers’ personal information.
Therefore, we are reinforcing information security by governance and risk management based on the Information Security Policy, formulated to clearly define our basic policy and attitude regarding information security, with the goal of taking necessary actions together with our subsidiaries.

Organization and Structure
Under the Chief Information Security Officer, security officers are respectively assigned in the individual security fields to promote activities.
Details of activities in each security field and overall common issues are shared and discussed at Information Security Management Meetings to improve information security throughout Toyota.
 

By annually inspecting the information security initiatives being taken at each company in line with the ATSG, Toyota is working to ensure continuous maintenance and improvement. Furthermore, starting in FY2019, TMC has been carrying out genchi genbutsu inspection of its subsidiaries for further improvements.
Structure for ATSG Implementation at Subsidiaries and Affiliates
 
1.	Request for ATSG introduction/ inspection

4. Improvement advice and support
6. Genchi genbutsu inspection of subsidiaries


 










Initiatives for Information Management
Toyota has established the All Toyota Security Guidelines (ATSG) covering TMC, its subsidiaries and affiliates, with the goal of comprehensively preventing information leaks and emerging risks of cyber attacks.
ATSG ensures information security through a multi-faced approach: through organization, human resources, technical security, physical security, and incident/accident response. To cope with recent environmental changes and increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks, ATSG is revised periodically.
 
In terms of automobile-related initiatives, Toyota is a member of Automotive Information Sharing & Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC) in Japan and United States, a framework for sharing knowledge related to information security and is actively utilizing it to immediately learn about cases that occur within the industry and put them to use in our company’s development phase.
Toyota also references the best practices in the industry (specifically, best practices found in Auto-ISAC) in order to protect its vehicles against cybersecurity risks. These include the concept of security by design,1 layered defense,2 and security tests.
For personal information, individual education ensures that employees are well aware of the importance of following the law and handling information appropriately. In FY2019, we checked our compliance status with regard to EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other regulations. We will keep checking for non-compliance on a regular basis in order to protect personal information.
1	Security by design: Design approach that defines the security requirements needed for safe system operations beginning from the planning and designing phases of an information system, and which aims to reliably incorporate these requirements into the information system through the development processes, by moving away from the approach of implementing security countermeasures only after a problem has been discovered.
2	Layered defense: Security practice of combining multiple defense “layers” in order to enhance security, so that an attack is not successful even if one layer is penetrated.

Business Continuity Management at Toyota

Although Toyota was not directly affected by recent large-scale disasters such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Thailand floods, our production operations stopped for a long period of time which inconvenienced our customers in terms of both sales and services.
There are deep concerns about the possibility of a Nankai Trough Massive Earthquake occurring, as the Toyota Group companies’ main functions are concentrated in that area. It is predicted that a large scale earthquake there would severely impact our production and logistics operations.
To be prepared for such disasters, the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) was established to facilitate early recovery of business operations despite resource limitations.
In order to contribute to enriching the lives of communities, Toyota will work on disaster recovery according to the Basic Guidelines.


Toyota’s Basic Guidelines (Priorities during a Disaster)
 

Business Continuity Management at Toyota
The PDCA is implemented and continuous improvement is undertaken through training, etc., to constantly raise the practical effectiveness of Toyota’s BCP.
These activities are identified as Business Continuity Management (BCM), promoted through coordination among employees and their families, Toyota Group companies and suppliers, and Toyota.
Through this process of formulation and review of the BCP, we aim to develop risk-resilient organizations, workplaces, and individuals.



 

Humanitarian Aid and Early Recovery of Disaster-affected Regions
Toyota has concluded comprehensive disaster support agreements with local governments (Toyota City, Miyoshi City, Tahara City, and Susono City). In accordance with the Basic Guidelines, these efforts will give priority to disaster recovery and contribute to building disaster-resilient communities.
Humanitarian support and regional recovery assistance are to be provided under mutual cooperation with local governments. Toyota is preparing relevant structures by incorporating necessary provisions in its business continuity plan (BCP) and conducting joint training with the local governments.
Details of the major support items are described below. In addition, we have agreed with individual local governments to provide support such as designated shelter facilities.

Building a Disaster-resilient Supply Chain with Suppliers
Toyota provides recovery support in accordance with the following priorities: (1) Humanitarian aid; (2) Early recovery of the affected area; (3) Restoration of Toyota’s operations and production. Since the Great East Japan Earthquake, we have worked with suppliers in each country and region to build a disaster-resilient supply chain by sharing supply chain information and setting up measures for prompt initial action and early recovery.
In sharing supply chain information in Japan, Toyota has received highly confidential information from suppliers and used it to build a database, the RESCUE (REinforce Supply Chain Under Emergency) system, based on the concept of protecting Japanese monozukuri (manufacturing). While strictly protecting suppliers’ confidential information, Toyota conducts regular trainings with suppliers to ensure effective utilization of this system in case of a disaster.
This system has been standardized and shared with other companies through the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, helping thus to build a disaster-resilient supply chain.
Toyota is implementing equivalent initiatives with suppliers in each country and region overseas.

   Fundamental Approach	

The Guiding Principles at Toyota state that Toyota shall “honor the language and spirit of the law of every country and region, and undertake open and fair business activities to be a strong corporate citizen of the world.” Toyota believes that adhering to this principle is to fulfill corporate social responsibility and ensure compliance.
The Toyota Code of Conduct (adopted in 1998 and revised in March 2006) outlines the basic frame of mind that all members of Toyota should adopt. It shows concrete guidelines for the Guiding Principles at Toyota to carry out social responsibilities. This booklet is distributed to all our employees.
We also hold Sustainability Meetings to report and discuss the expectations of our stakeholders and our responses to various social issues including compliance.
 
Ensuring Compliance
To ensure that awareness of compliance extends throughout the company, Toyota conducts training programs for directors, managers and newly recruited employees together with company- wide e-learning programs.
The Legal Division also conducts seminars at individual divisions on a wide range of topics based on their specific needs.
 

 

Checks to Enhance Compliance
In FY2009, Toyota began implementing internal checks to enhance its compliance structure. In FY2010 these checks were extended to subsidiaries in and outside Japan. Since then, these checks have been carried out and improved every year.
Results are reported to Sustainability Meeting and used as a basis for further improvement. By incorporating improvement points into each year’s action plans, we ensure that these checks lead to continuous improvement.
We also have discussions with subsidiaries to understand their compliance efforts and provide support when needed.

Corruption Prevention Measures
In response to the global expansion of our business and social demands, Toyota adopted the Antibribery Guidelines in 2012 to eliminate corruption. Toyota is strengthening its preventive measures and working to prevent corruption by raising awareness through internal training and by informing business partners as well.
Furthermore, Toyota has been incorporating bribery prevention into self-inspection check sheets since 2013 and has been promoting improvement including in our subsidiaries.

The Compliance Hotline
Toyota has established hotlines for quick and appropriate responses to concerns, complaints, or questions that employees may have.
We have set up the Compliance Hotline, run by an outside law firm (subcontractor), which allows employees to have consultations concerning compliance-related issues. We are making sure that everyone is aware of the hotline by distributing contact cards to all employees and regularly setting up pop-up displays in cafeterias, and employees are making use of the hotline.
Upon request, the content of consultations may be made anonymously. The consultations are passed to the responsible division and the details are investigated carefully to ensure that the employee who made the consultation is not identified. If the results of the investigation indicate an issue, a response is immediately implemented.
For cases where we confirmed that there actually was an issue, we confirmed the facts and took appropriate measures in accordance with company regulations such as Work Regulations.
